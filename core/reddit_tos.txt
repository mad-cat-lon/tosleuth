 User Agreement Privacy Policy Content Policy Broadcasting Content Policy Moderator Guidelines Cookie Notice Premium and Virtual Goods Agreement Previews Terms of Use Guidelines for Law Enforcement Transparency Report 2019 Transparency Report 2018 Transparency Report 2017 Privacy Policy Reddit Privacy Policy Effective October 15, 2020. Last Revised September 15, 2020 <p>We want you to understand how and why Reddit, Inc. (“Reddit,” “we” or “us”) collects, uses, and shares information about you when you use our sites, mobile apps, widgets, and other online products and services (collectively, the "Services") or when you otherwise interact with us or receive a communication from us. This Privacy Policy applies to all of our Services including Reddit Gifts, which maintains a separate privacy notice that incorporates this Privacy Policy by reference    .</p> <strong>

What We Collect

(and How it is Used and Shared)

</strong> <br> <u>Information You Provide to Us</u> <br>We collect information you provide to us directly when you use the Services. This includes:<em> <br>Account information</em> <br>If you create a Reddit account, we may require you to provide a username and password. Your username is public, and it doesn’t have to be related to your real name. You may also provide other account information, like an email address, bio, or profile picture. We also store your user account preferences and settings. <em> <br>Content you submit</em> <br>We collect the content you submit to the Services.

This includes your posts and comments including saved drafts, videos you broadcast via RPAN, your messages with other users (e.g., private messages, chats, and modmail), and your reports and other communications with moderators and with us.

Your content may include text, links, images, gifs, and videos.<em> <br>Actions you take</em> <br>We collect information about the actions you take when using the Services. This includes your interactions with content, like voting, saving, hiding, and reporting. It also includes your interactions with other users, such as following, friending, and blocking. We collect your interactions with communities, like your subscriptions or moderator status.<em> <br>Transactional information</em> <br>If you purchase products or services from us (e.g., Reddit Premium or Reddit Coins), we will collect certain information from you, including your name, address, email address, and information about the product or service you are purchasing.

Reddit uses industry-standard payment processor services (for example, Stripe) to handle payment information.

<em> <br>Other information</em> <br>

You may choose to provide other information directly to us. For example, we may collect information when you fill out a form, participate in Reddit-sponsored activities or promotions, apply for a job,

request customer support, or otherwise communicate with us.<br> <p> </p> <br> <u>Information We Collect Automatically</u> <br>When you access or use our Services, we may also automatically collect information about you. This includes:<em> <br>Log and usage data</em>

<br>We may log information when you access and use the Services. This may include your IP address,

user-agent string, browser type, operating system,

referral URLs,

device information (e.g., device IDs), device settings, pages visited, links clicked, the requested URL, and search terms. Except for the IP address used to create your account, Reddit will delete any IP addresses collected after 100 days. <em> <br>Information collected from cookies and similar technologies</em> <br>

We may receive information from cookies, which are pieces of data your browser stores and sends back to us when making requests, and similar technologies.

We use this information to improve your experience, understand user activity, personalize content and advertisements, and improve the quality of our Services. For example, we store and retrieve information about your preferred language and other settings. See our Cookie Notice for more information about how Reddit uses cookies. For more information on how you can disable cookies, please see “Your Choices” below.<em> <br> </em> <p> <em> <em>Location information</em> </em> </p> <br>

We may receive and process information about your location. For example, with your consent, we may collect information about the specific location of your mobile device (for example, by using GPS or Bluetooth). We may also receive location information from you when you choose to share such information on our Services, including by associating your content with a location, or we may derive your approximate location from other information about you, including your IP address.

<br> <p> </p> <br>

<u>Information Collected from Other Sources</u> <br>We may receive information about you from other sources, including from other users and third parties, and combine that information with the other information we have about you.

For example, we may receive demographic or interest information about you from third parties, including advertisers (such as the fact that an advertiser is interested in showing you an ad), and combine it with our own data using a common account identifier such as a hash of an email address or a mobile-device ID.

You can control how we use this information to personalize the Services for you as described in “Your Choices - Controlling Advertising and Analytics” below.<em> <br>Linked services</em> <br>If you authorize or link a third-party service (e.g., an unofficial mobile app client) to access your Reddit account, Reddit receives information about your use of that service when it uses that authorization. Linking services may also cause the other service to send us information about your account with that service. For example, if you sign in to Reddit with a third-party identity provider, that provider may share an email address with us. To learn how information is shared with linked services, see “How Information About You Is Shared” below. <em> <br>Information collected from integrations</em> <br>

We also may receive information about you, including log and usage data and cookie information, from third-party sites that integrate our Services, including our embeds and advertising technology.

For example, when you visit a site that uses Reddit embeds, we may receive information about the web page you visited. Similarly, if an advertiser incorporates Reddit’s ad technology, Reddit may receive limited information about your activity on the advertiser’s site or app, such as whether you bought something from the advertiser.

You can control how we use this information to personalize the Services for you as described in “Your Choices - Controlling Advertising and Analytics” below.<br> <p> </p> <br> <u>Information Collected by Third Parties</u> <em> <br>Embedded content</em> <br>Reddit displays some linked content in-line on the Reddit services via “embeds.” For example, Reddit posts that link to YouTube or Twitter may load the linked video or tweet within Reddit directly from those services to your device so you don’t have to leave Reddit to see it. In general, Reddit does not control how third-party services collect data when they serve you their content directly via these embeds. As a result, embedded content is not covered by this privacy policy but by the policies of the service from which the content is embedded. <em> <br>

Programmatic ads</em> <br>We partner with third-party programmatic ad exchanges to show advertisements relevant to your interests.

In providing those ads, those third parties collect information, including log and usage data and information from cookies as described above. These third parties do not receive any information from your Reddit account.<em> <br>Audience measurement</em> <br>

We partner with audience measurement companies (including Quantcast and Nielsen) to learn demographic information about the population that uses Reddit.

To provide this demographic information, these companies collect cookie information to recognize your device.<br> <p> </p> <br> <u>Information Collected from Advertisers and Potential Advertisers</u> <br>If you use Reddit Ads (Reddit’s self-serve ads platform at ads.reddit.com) we collect some additional information. To sign up for Reddit Ads, you must provide your name, email address, and information about your company. If you purchase advertising services, you will need to provide transactional information as described above, and we may also require additional documentation to verify your identity. When using Reddit Ads, we may record a session replay of your visit for customer service, troubleshooting, and usability research purposes.<br> <p> <br>We use information about you to:</p> <ul> <li>Provide, maintain, and improve the Services;</li> <li>Research and develop new services;</li> <li>Help protect the safety of Reddit and our users, which includes blocking suspected spammers, addressing abuse, and enforcing the Reddit User Agreement and our other policies;</li> <li>Send you technical notices, updates, security alerts, invoices, and other support and administrative messages;</li> <li>Provide customer service;</li> <li>

Communicate with you about products, services, offers, promotions, and events, and provide other news and information we think will be of interest to you

(for information about how to opt out of these communications, see “Your Choices” below);</li> <li>Monitor and analyze trends, usage, and activities in connection with our Services. </li> <li>Measure the effectiveness of ads shown on our Services. and</li> <li>Personalize the Services, and provide and optimize advertisements, content, and features that match user profiles or interests.</li> </ul> <p>Much of the information on the Services is public and accessible to everyone, even without an account. By using the Services, you are directing us to share this information publicly and freely.</p> <p>When you submit content (including a post, comment, chat message, or RPAN broadcast) to a public part of the Services, any visitors to and users of our Services will be able to see that content, the username associated with the content, and the date and time you originally submitted the content. Reddit allows other sites to embed public Reddit content via our embed tools. Reddit also allows third parties to access public Reddit content via the Reddit API and other similar technologies.

Although some parts of the Services may be private or quarantined, they may become public (e.g., at the moderator’s option in the case of private communities) and you should take that into consideration before posting to the Services.</p>

<p>Your Reddit account has a profile page that is public. Your profile contains information about your activities on the Services, such as your username, prior posts and comments, karma, awards received, trophies, moderator status, Reddit Premium status, and how long you have been a member of the Services. You can also choose for your profile to include the content you upvote and downvote.</p> <p>We offer social sharing features that let you share content or actions you take on our Services with other media. Your use of these features enables the sharing of certain information with your friends or the public, depending on the settings you establish with the third party that provides the social sharing feature. For more information about the purpose and scope of data collection and processing in connection with social sharing features, please visit the privacy policies of the third parties that provide these social sharing features (e.g., Tumblr, Facebook, and Twitter).</p> <p>

Reddit only shares nonpublic information about you in the following ways. We do not sell this information.

</p> <ul> <li> <em>With your consent.</em> We may share information about you with your consent or at your direction.</li> <li> <em>

With linked services.</em> If you link your Reddit account with a third-party service, Reddit will share the information you authorize with that third-party service. You can control this sharing as described in "Your Choices" below.</li> <li> <em>With our service providers.</em> We may share information with vendors, consultants, and other service providers who need access to such information to carry out work for us.

Their use of personal data will be subject to appropriate confidentiality and security measures.

A few examples: (i) payment processors who process transactions on our behalf, (ii) cloud providers who host our data and our services, (iii) third-party ads measurement providers who help us and advertisers measure the performance of ads shown on our Services.</li> <li> <em>To comply with the law.</em> We may share information in response to a request for information if we believe disclosure is in accordance with, or required by, any applicable law, regulation, legal process, or governmental request, including, but not limited to, meeting national security or law enforcement requirements.

To the extent the law allows it, we will attempt to provide you with prior notice before disclosing your information in response to such a request.

Our Transparency Report has additional information about how we respond to government requests.</li> <li> <em>In an emergency.</em> We may share information if we believe it's necessary to prevent imminent and serious bodily harm to a person.</li> <li> <em>To enforce our policies and rights.</em> We may share information if we believe your actions are inconsistent with our User Agreement, rules, or other Reddit policies, or to protect the rights, property, and safety of ourselves and others.</li> <li> <em>With our affiliates.</em> We may share information between and among Reddit, and any of our parents, affiliates, subsidiaries, and other companies under common control and ownership.</li> <li> <em>Aggregated or de-identified information.</em>

We may share information about you that has been aggregated or anonymized such that it cannot reasonably be used to identify you. For example, we may show the total number of times a post has been upvoted without identifying who the visitors were, or we may tell an advertiser how many people saw their ad.

</li> </ul> <strong>How We Protect Your Information</strong> <p>We take measures to help protect information about you from loss, theft, misuse and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, and destruction. For example, we use HTTPS while information is being transmitted. We also enforce technical and administrative access controls to limit which of our employees have access to nonpublic personal information.</p> <p>You can help maintain the security of your account by configuring two-factor authentication.</p> <p>

We store the information we collect for as long as it is necessary for the purpose(s) for which we originally collected it.

We may retain certain information for legitimate business purposes or as required by law.

</p> <strong>Your Choices</strong> <p>You have choices about how to protect and limit the collection, use, and sharing of information about you when you use the Services. Some of these choices are available to everyone who uses Reddit, while others only apply if you have a Reddit account.</p> <br> <em>Accessing and Changing Your Information</em> <br>You can access and change certain information through the Services. See our Help Center page for more information.

You can also request a copy of the personal information Reddit maintains about you by following the process described here.

<br> <em>Deleting Your Account</em> <br>

You may delete your account information at any time from the user preferences page.

You can also submit a request to delete the personal information Reddit maintains about you by following the process described in the “Your Rights - Data Subject and Consumer Information Requests” section below. When you delete your account, your profile is no longer visible to other users and disassociated from content you posted under that account.

Please note, however, that the posts, comments, and messages you submitted prior to deleting your account will still be visible to others unless you first delete the specific content. We may also retain certain information about you as required by law or for legitimate business purposes after you delete your account.<br>

<em>Controlling Linked Services’ Access to Your Account</em> <br>You can review the services you have permitted to access your account and revoke access to individual services by visiting your account’s Apps page (for third-party app authorizations) and the Connected Accounts section of your Account Settings (for Google Sign-In, Sign in with Apple, and connected Twitter accounts).<br> <em>Controlling the Use of Cookies</em> <br>Most web browsers are set to accept cookies by default.

If you prefer, you can usually choose to set your browser to remove or reject first- and third-party cookies. Please note that if you choose to remove or reject cookies, this could affect the availability and functionality of our Services.

For more information on controlling how cookies and similar technologies are used on Reddit, see our Cookie Notice.<br> <em>Controlling Advertising and Analytics</em> <br>Some analytics providers we partner with may provide specific opt-out mechanisms and we may provide, as needed and as available, additional tools and third-party services that allow you to better understand cookies and how you can opt out. For example, you may manage the use and collection of certain information by Google Analytics via the Google Analytics Opt-out Browser Add-on. You can opt out of the Audience Measurement services provided by Nielsen and Quantcast.<br> <br>

We also offer you choices about receiving personalized advertisements. You can adjust how we personalize advertisements for you by visiting your ads preferences in your account settings, or here if you use Reddit in a web browser. You can also use device-level settings to control personalized advertisements on Android (“Reset advertising ID” and “Opt out of Ads Personalization”) and iOS (“Limit Ad Tracking”) devices. You may also generally opt out of receiving personalized advertisements from certain third-party advertisers and ad networks.

To learn more about these advertisements or to opt out, please visit the sites of the Digital Advertising Alliance and the Network Advertising Initiative, or if you are a user in the European Economic Area, Your Online Choices.<br> <em>Do Not Track</em> <br>

Most modern web browsers give you the option to send a Do Not Track signal to the sites you visit, indicating that you do not wish to be tracked. However, there is no accepted standard for how a site should respond to this signal, and we do not take any action in response to this signal

. Instead, in addition to publicly available third-party tools, we offer you the choices described in this policy to manage the collection and use of information about you.<br> <em>Controlling Promotional Communications</em> <br>

You may opt out of receiving some or all categories of promotional communications from us by following the instructions in those communications or by updating your email options in your account preferences here. If you opt out of promotional communications, we may still send you non-promotional communications, such as information about your account or your use of the Services.

<br> <em>Controlling Mobile Notifications</em> <br>With your consent, we may send promotional and non-promotional push notifications or alerts to your mobile device. You can deactivate these messages at any time by changing the notification settings on your mobile device.<br> <em>Controlling Location Information</em> <br>You can control how we use location information inferred from your IP address for content recommendation purposes via the Safety and Privacy settings on your account. If you initially consent to our collection of more precise location information from your device, you can subsequently stop the collection of this information at any time by changing the preferences on your mobile device.<br> <strong>Your Rights</strong> <strong>Data Subject and Consumer Information Requests</strong> <p>Requests for a copy of the information Reddit has about your account—including EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) data subject access requests and California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) consumer information requests—can be submitted following the process described here.<br> <br>All other data subject and consumer requests under data protection laws should be sent via email to redditdatarequests@reddit.com from the email address that you have verified with your Reddit account.<br> <br>Before we process a request from you about your personal information, we need to verify the request via your access to your Reddit account or to a verified email address associated with your Reddit account. You may also designate an authorized agent to exercise these rights on your behalf. Reddit does not discriminate against users for exercising their rights under data protection laws to make requests regarding their personal information.</p> <strong>International Data Transfers</strong> <p>We are based in the United States and we process and store information on servers located in the United States.

Last Revised September 15, 2020 <p> <strong>Reddit powers hundreds of thousands of distinct online communities.<br> </strong> <strong>This User Agreement and your conduct make that possible.</strong> </p> <p>Hello, redditors and people of the Internet! This Reddit User Agreement (“<strong>Terms</strong>”) applies to your access to and use of the websites, mobile apps, widgets, APIs, emails, and other online products and services (collectively, the “<strong>Services</strong>”) provided by Reddit, Inc. (“<strong>Reddit</strong>,” “<strong>we</strong>,” “<strong>us</strong>,” or “<strong>our</strong>”).<br> <br>Remember Reddit is for fun and is intended to be a place for your entertainment, but we still need some basic rules. By accessing or using our Services, you agree to be bound by these Terms. If you do not agree to these Terms, you may not access or use our Services.<br> <br>Please take a look at Reddit’s Privacy Policy too—it explains how and why we collect, use, and share information about you when you access or use our Services.</p> <strong>1. Your Access to the Services</strong>

<p>Children under the age of 13 are not allowed to create an Account or otherwise use the Services. Additionally, you must be over the age required by the laws of your country to create an account or otherwise use the Services, or we need to have received verifiable consent from your parent or legal guardian.</p> <p>In addition, certain of our Services or portions of our Services require you to be 18 years of age or older, so please read all notices and any Additional Terms carefully when you access the Services.

</p> <p>If you are accepting these Terms on behalf of another legal entity, including a business or government entity, you represent that you have full legal authority to bind such entity to these Terms.</p> <strong>2. Your Use of the Services</strong> <p>Reddit grants you a personal, non-transferable, non-exclusive, revocable, limited license to use and access the Services solely as permitted by these Terms. We reserve all rights not expressly granted to you by these Terms.</p> <p>Except as permitted through the Services or as otherwise permitted by us in writing, your license does not include the right to:</p> <ul> <li>license, sell, transfer, assign, distribute, host, or otherwise commercially exploit the Services or Content;</li> <li>modify, prepare derivative works of, disassemble, decompile, or reverse engineer any part of the Services or Content. or</li> <li>access the Services or Content in order to build a similar or competitive website, product, or service, except as permitted under the Reddit API Terms of Use.</li> </ul> <p>We reserve the right to modify, suspend, or discontinue the Services (in whole or in part) at any time, with or without notice to you. Any future release, update, or other addition to functionality of the Services will be subject to these Terms, which may be updated from time to time. You agree that we will not be liable to you or to any third party for any modification, suspension, or discontinuation of the Services or any part thereof.</p> <strong>3. Your Reddit Account and Account Security</strong> <p>To use certain features of our Services, you may be required to create a Reddit account (an “<strong>Account</strong>”) and provide us with a username, password, and certain other information about yourself as set forth in the Privacy Policy.</p> <p>You are solely responsible for the information associated with your Account and anything that happens related to your Account. You must maintain the security of your Account and immediately notify Reddit if you discover or suspect that someone has accessed your Account without your permission. We recommend that you use a strong password that is used only with your Account and enable two-factor authentication.</p> <p>You will not license, sell, or transfer your Account without our prior written approval.</p> <strong>4. Your Content</strong> <p>The Services may contain information, text, links, graphics, photos, videos, or other materials (“<strong>Content</strong>”), including Content created or submitted to the Services by you or through your Account (“<strong>Your Content</strong>”). We take no responsibility for and we do not expressly or implicitly endorse, support, or guarantee the completeness, truthfulness, accuracy, or reliability of any of Your Content.</p> <p>By submitting Your Content to the Services, you represent and warrant that you have all rights, power, and authority necessary to grant the rights to Your Content contained within these Terms.

Because you alone are responsible for Your Content, you may expose yourself to liability if you post or share Content without all necessary rights.

</p> <p>You retain any ownership rights you have in Your Content, but you grant Reddit the following license to use that Content:</p>

<p>When Your Content is created with or submitted to the Services, you grant us a worldwide, royalty-free, perpetual, irrevocable,

non-exclusive, transferable, and sublicensable license

to use, copy, modify, adapt, prepare derivative works of, distribute, store, perform, and display Your Content and any name, username, voice, or likeness provided in connection with Your Content in all media formats and channels now known or later developed anywhere in the world.

This license includes the right for us to make Your Content available for syndication, broadcast, distribution, or publication by other companies, organizations, or individuals who partner with Reddit. You also agree that we may remove metadata associated with Your Content, and you irrevocably waive any claims and assertions of moral rights or attribution with respect to Your Content.</p> <p>Any ideas, suggestions, and feedback about Reddit or our Services that you provide to us are entirely voluntary, and you agree that Reddit may use such ideas, suggestions, and feedback without compensation or obligation to you.</p> <p>Although we have no obligation to screen, edit, or monitor Your Content, we may, in our sole discretion, delete or remove Your Content at any time and for any reason, including for violating these Terms, violating our Content Policy, or if you otherwise create or are likely to create liability for us.</p> <strong>5. Third-Party Content, Advertisements, and Promotions</strong>

<p>The Services may contain links to third-party websites, products, or services, which may be posted by advertisers, our affiliates, our partners, or other users (“<strong>Third-Party Content</strong>”). Third-Party Content is not under our control, and we are not responsible for any third party’s websites, products, or services.

 User Agreement Privacy Policy Content Policy Broadcasting Content Policy Moderator Guidelines Cookie Notice Premium and Virtual Goods Agreement Previews Terms of Use Guidelines for Law Enforcement Trademark Use Policy Transparency Report 2019 Transparency Report 2018 Transparency Report 2017 Content Policy Reddit Content Policy <p>Reddit is a vast network of communities that are created, run, and populated by you, the Reddit users.</p> <p>Through these communities, you can post, comment, vote, discuss, learn, debate, support, and connect with people who share your interests, and we encourage you to find—or even create—your home on Reddit.</p> <p>While not every community may be for you (and you may find some unrelatable or even offensive), no community should be used as a weapon. Communities should create a sense of belonging for their members, not try to diminish it for others. Likewise, everyone on Reddit should have an expectation of privacy and safety, so please respect the privacy and safety of others.</p> <p>Every community on Reddit is defined by its users. Some of these users help manage the community as moderators. The culture of each community is shaped explicitly, by the community rules enforced by moderators, and implicitly, by the upvotes, downvotes, and discussions of its community members. Please abide by the rules of communities in which you participate and do not interfere with those in which you are not a member.</p> <p>Below the rules governing each community are the platform-wide rules that apply to everyone on Reddit. These rules are enforced by us, the admins.</p> <p>Reddit and its communities are only what we make of them together, and can only exist if we operate by a shared set of rules. We ask that you abide by not just the letter of these rules, but the spirit as well.</p> <strong>Rules</strong> <strong>

Rule 1</strong> <p>Remember the human. Reddit is a place for creating community and belonging, not for attacking marginalized or vulnerable groups of people. Everyone has a right to use Reddit free of harassment, bullying, and threats of violence. Communities and users that incite violence or that promote hate based on identity or vulnerability will be banned

.</p> <strong>

Rule 2</strong> <p>Abide by community rules. Post authentic content into communities where you have a personal interest, and do not cheat or engage in content manipulation (including spamming, vote manipulation, ban evasion, or subscriber fraud) or otherwise interfere with or disrupt Reddit communities.

</p> <strong>Rule 3</strong> <p>Respect the privacy of others. Instigating harassment, for example by revealing someone’s personal or confidential information, is not allowed. Never post or threaten to post intimate or sexually-explicit media of someone without their consent.</p> <strong>Rule 4</strong> <p>Do not post or encourage the posting of sexual or suggestive content involving minors.</p> <strong>

Rule 5</strong> <p>You don’t have to use your real name to use Reddit, but don’t impersonate an individual or an entity in a misleading or deceptive manner.</p>

<strong>Rule 6</strong> <p>Ensure people have predictable experiences on Reddit by properly labeling content and communities, particularly content that is graphic, sexually-explicit, or offensive.</p> <strong>Rule 7</strong> <p>Keep it legal, and avoid posting illegal content or soliciting or facilitating illegal or prohibited transactions.</p> <strong>Rule 8</strong> <p>Don’t break the site or do anything that interferes with normal use of Reddit.</p> <strong>Enforcement</strong> <p>We have a variety of ways of enforcing our rules, including, but not limited to</p> <ul> <li>Asking you nicely to knock it off</li> <li>Asking you less nicely</li> <li>Temporary or permanent suspension of accounts</li> <li>Removal of privileges from, or adding restrictions to, accounts</li> <li>Adding restrictions to Reddit communities, such as adding NSFW tags or Quarantining</li> <li>Removal of content</li> <li>Banning of Reddit communities</li> </ul>
