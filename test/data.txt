What do I do here?\n<p>Telegram is a messaging app with a focus on speed and security, it\u2019s super-fast, simple and free.\nYou can use Telegram on all your devices <strong>at the same time</strong> \u2014 your messages sync seamlessly across any number of your phones, tablets or computers.</p>\n<p>With Telegram, you can send messages, photos, videos and <strong>files</strong> of any type (doc, zip, mp3, etc), as well as create groups for up to <strong>200,000</strong> people or channels for broadcasting to <strong>unlimited</strong> audiences.\nYou can write to your phone contacts and find people by their <strong>usernames</strong>.\nAs a result, Telegram is like SMS and email combined \u2014 and can take care of all your personal or business messaging needs.\nIn addition to this, we support end-to-end encrypted voice calls.</p>\n<i>\n</i>Q: Who is Telegram for?\n<p>Telegram is for everyone who wants fast and reliable messaging and calls.\nBusiness users and small teams may like the large groups, usernames, desktop apps and powerful file sharing options.</p>\n<p>Since Telegram groups can have up to 200,000 members, we support replies, mentions and hashtags that help maintain order and keep communication in large communities efficient.\nYou can appoint admins with advanced tools to help these communities prosper in peace.\nPublic groups can be joined by anyone and are powerful platforms for discussions and collecting feedback.</p>\n<p>In case you're more into pictures, Telegram has animated gif search, a state of the art photo editor, and an open sticker platform (find some cool stickers here or here).\nWhat's more, there is no need to worry about disk space on your device.\nWith Telegram's cloud support and cache management options, Telegram can take up nearly <strong>zero</strong> space on your phone.</p>\n<p>Those looking for extra privacy should check out our advanced settings and rather revolutionary policy.\nAnd if you want secrecy, try our device-specific Secret Chats with self-destructing messages, photos, and videos \u2014 and lock your app with an additional passcode.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>We keep evolving \u2014 check out the blog and follow us on twitter and Telegram to stay in touch.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<i>\n</i>Q: How is Telegram different from WhatsApp?\n<p>Unlike WhatsApp, Telegram is a cloud-based messenger with seamless sync.\nAs a result, you can access your messages from several devices at once, including tablets and computers, and share an unlimited number of photos, videos and files (doc, zip, mp3, etc.) of up to 2 GB <em>each</em>.\nAnd if you don't want to store all that data on your device, you can always keep it in the cloud.</p>\n<p>Thanks to our multi-data center infrastructure and encryption, Telegram is faster and way more secure.\nOn top of that, Telegram is free and will stay free \u2014 no ads, no subscription fees, forever.</p>\n<p>Our API is open, and we welcome developers to create their own Telegram apps.\nWe also have a Bot API, a platform for developers that allows anyone to easily build specialized tools for Telegram, integrate any services, and even accept payments from users around the world.\n</p>\n<p>And that's just the tip of the iceberg.\nDon't forget to check out this paragraph for even more exclusive stuff.</p>\n<i>\n</i>Q: How old is Telegram?\n<p>Telegram for iOS was launched on August 14, 2013.\nThe alpha version of Telegram for Android officially launched on October 20, 2013.\nMore and more Telegram clients appear, built by independent developers using Telegram's open platform.</p>\n<i>\n</i>Q: Which devices can I use?\n<p>You can use Telegram on smartphones, tablets, and even computers.\nWe have apps for iOS (9.0 and above), Android (4.1 and up) and Windows Phone.\nYou can also use Telegram's web version or install one of our desktop apps for Windows, macOS, and Linux.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>You can log in to Telegram from as many of your devices as you like \u2014 all <strong>at the same time</strong>.\nJust use your main mobile phone number to log in everywhere.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Our API is open for developers, should you want to build your own applications for other platforms.\n</p>\n<i>\n</i>Q: Who are the people behind Telegram?\n<p>Telegram is supported by Pavel Durov and his brother Nikolai.\nPavel supports Telegram financially and ideologically while Nikolai's input is technological.\nTo make Telegram possible, Nikolai developed a unique custom data protocol, which is open, secure and optimized for work with multiple data-centers.\nAs a result, Telegram combines security, reliability and speed on any network.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>See also: articles about Telegram</p>\n</blockquote>\n<i>\n</i>Q: Where is Telegram based?\n<p>The Telegram development team is based in Dubai.</p>\n<p>Most of the developers behind Telegram originally come from St.\nPetersburg, the city famous for its unprecedented number of highly skilled engineers.\nThe Telegram team had to leave Russia due to local IT regulations and has tried a number of locations as its base, including Berlin, London and Singapore.\nWe\u2019re currently happy with Dubai, although are ready to relocate again if local regulations change.</p>\n<i>\n</i>Q: Will you have ads? Or sell my data? Or steal my beloved and enslave my children?\n<p>No.</p>\n<i>\n</i>Q: How are you going to make money out of this?\n<p>We believe in fast and secure messaging that is also 100% free.</p>\n<p>Pavel Durov, who shares our vision, supplied Telegram with a generous donation, so we have quite enough money for the time being.\nIf Telegram runs out, we will introduce non-essential paid options to support the infrastructure and finance developer salaries.\nBut making profits will never be an end-goal for Telegram.\n</p>\n<i>\n</i>Q: What are your thoughts on internet privacy?\n<p>Big internet companies like Facebook or Google have effectively hijacked the privacy discourse in the recent years.\nTheir marketers managed to convince the public that the most important things about privacy are superficial tools that allow hiding your public posts from the people around you.\nAdding these superficial tools enables companies to calm down the public and change nothing in how they are turning over private data to marketers and other third parties.</p>\n<p>At Telegram we think that the two most important components of Internet privacy should be instead:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Protecting your private conversations from snooping third parties, such as officials, employers, etc.</li>\n<li>Protecting your personal data from third parties, such as marketers, advertisers, etc.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>This is what everybody should care about, and these are some of our top priorities.\nTelegram's aim is to create a truly free messenger, without the usual caveats.\nThis means that instead of diverting public attention with low-impact settings, we can afford to focus on the real privacy issues that exist in the modern world.</p>\n<i>\n</i>Q: What about GDPR?\n<p>New regulations regarding data privacy called the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) came into force in Europe on May 25, 2018.\nSince taking back our right to privacy was the reason we made Telegram, there wasn't much we had to change.\nWe don\u2019t use your data for ad targeting, we don\u2019t sell it to others, and we're not part of any mafia family \u201cfamily of companies.\u201d</p>\n<p>Telegram only keeps the information it needs to function as a feature-rich cloud service \u2014 for example, your cloud chats so that you can access them from any devices without using third-party backups, or your contacts so that you can rely on your existing social graph when messaging people on Telegram.\nPlease see our Privacy Policy for more information.</p>\n<p>You can use <strong>@GDPRbot</strong> to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Request a copy of all your data that Telegram stores.</li>\n<li>Contact us about Data Privacy.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Android users got a GDPR update with version 4.8.9 which allows more control over synced contacts and adds other privacy settings.\nOn June, 1, Apple approved Telegram v.4.8.2 for iOS with these features.</p>\n<i>\n</i>Q: There's illegal content on Telegram.\nHow do I take it down?\n<p>All Telegram chats and group chats are private amongst their participants.\nWe do not process any requests related to them.</p>\n<p>But <strong>sticker sets</strong>, <strong>channels</strong>, and <strong>bots</strong> on Telegram are <em>publicly available</em>.\nIf you find sticker sets or bots on Telegram that you think are illegal, please ping us at abuse@telegram.org.</p>\n<p>You can also use the 'report' buttons right inside our apps, see this post on our official @ISISwatch channel for details.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Note: If a scammer is pretending to be you, contact @NoToScam</p>\n</blockquote>\n<i>\n</i>Q: A bot or channel is infringing on my copyright.\nWhat do I do?\n<p>All Telegram chats and group chats are private amongst their participants.\nWe do not process any requests related to them.\nBut <strong>sticker sets</strong>, <strong>channels</strong>, and <strong>bots</strong> on Telegram are <em>publicly available</em>.</p>\n<p>If you see a bot, channel, or sticker set that is infringing on your copyright, kindly submit a complaint to dmca@telegram.org.\nPlease note that such requests should only be submitted by the copyright owner or an agent authorized to act on the owner\u2019s behalf.</p>\n<i>\n</i>Q: Wait! 0_o Do you process take-down requests from third parties?\n<p>Our mission is to provide a secure means of communication that works everywhere on the planet.\nTo do this in the places where it is most needed (and to continue distributing Telegram through the App Store and Google Play), we have to process legitimate requests to take down illegal <strong>public</strong> content (e.g., sticker sets, bots, and channels) within the app.\nFor example, we can take down sticker sets that violate intellectual property rights or porn bots.</p>\n<p>User-uploaded stickers sets, channels, and bots by third-party developers are not part of the core Telegram UI.\nWhenever we receive a complaint at abuse@telegram.org or dmca@telegram.org regarding the legality of public content, we perform the necessary legal checks and take it down when deemed appropriate.</p>\n<p>Please note that this does <strong>not</strong> apply to local restrictions on freedom of speech.\nFor example, if criticizing the government is illegal in some country, Telegram won't be a part of such politically motivated censorship.\nThis goes against our founders' principles.\nWhile we do block terrorist (e.g.\nISIS-related) bots and channels, we will not block anybody who peacefully expresses alternative opinions.</p>\n<i>\n</i>Q: My bot or sticker set was banned unfairly, what do I do?\n<p>If you think we banned your bot, channel, or sticker set for no apparent reasons, drop us a line at abuse@telegram.org.</p>\n<i>\n</i>Q: Do you process data requests?\n<p>Secret chats use end-to-end encryption, thanks to which we don't have any data to disclose.</p>\n<p>To protect the data that is not covered by end-to-end encryption, Telegram uses a distributed infrastructure.\nCloud chat data is stored in multiple data centers around the globe that are controlled by different legal entities spread across different jurisdictions.\nThe relevant decryption keys are split into parts and are never kept in the same place as the data they protect.\nAs a result, several court orders from different jurisdictions are required to force us to give up any data.</p>\n<p>Thanks to this structure, we can ensure that no single government or block of like-minded countries can intrude on people's privacy and freedom of expression.\nTelegram can be forced to give up data only if an issue is grave and universal enough to pass the scrutiny of several different legal systems around the world.</p>\n<p>To this day, we have disclosed 0 bytes of user data to third parties, including governments.</p>\n<i>\n</i>Telegram Basics\n<i>\n</i>Q: Who can I write to?\n<p>You can write to people who are in your phone contacts and have Telegram.\nAnother way of contacting people is to type their Telegram username into the search field.</p>\n<p>You can set a public username for your Telegram account too.\nOther people will be able to search and find you by that username \u2014 and send messages to you even if they don't know your number.\nYou can learn more about usernames here.</p>\n<i>\n</i>Q: How do I know who in my contacts has Telegram?\n<p>Your contacts, who have Telegram, are shown at the top of your Contacts.\nThey also have pictures.</p>\n<i>\n</i>Q: How do I invite my friends?\n<p>\n<em>iOS:</em> The basic invitations are simple SMS messages.\nThey will be charged as standard outgoing SMS by your carrier (unless sent via iMessage).\nNaturally, you have other options to bring your friends here.\nTry sending them a download link via any other messaging service: email, Facebook, WhatsApp, an actual telegram \u2014 you name it.\nThe link: <strong>\n</strong>\n<strong>https://telegram.org/dl/</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>Android:</em> Open the app menu (swipe right in chat list) &gt.\nInvite Friends.\nThen choose an application via which you would like to send out invitations.</p>\n<p>\n<em>Windows Phone:</em> Go to Contacts &gt.\nInvite Friends.\nThen choose an application via which you would like to send out invitations.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>You can give your friends a t.me link with your username so that they can easily find you on Telegram even if they don't have your phone number.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<i>\n</i>Q: What do the check marks mean?\n<p>\n<em>One check</em> \u2014 message delivered to the Telegram cloud and your friend has been notified if he allows notifications.<br>\n<em>Two checks</em> \u2014 message read (your friend opened Telegram and opened the conversation with the message).</p>\n<p>We don't have a 'delivered to device' status for messages because Telegram can run on as many devices as you want.\nSo which particular one would that check mean?</p>\n<i>\n</i>Q: Can I hide my \u2018last seen\u2019 time?\n<p>You can choose who sees this info in Privacy and Security settings.</p>\n<p>Remember that you won't see Last Seen timestamps for people with whom you don't share your own.\nYou will, however, see an approximate last seen value.\nThis keeps stalkers away but makes it possible to understand whether a person is reachable over Telegram.\nThere are four possible approximate values:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>Last seen recently</strong> \u2014 covers anything between 1 second and 2-3 days</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Last seen within a week</strong> \u2014 between 2-3 and seven days</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Last seen within a month</strong> \u2014 between 6-7 days and a month</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Last seen a long time ago</strong> \u2014 more than a month (this is also always shown to blocked users)</li>\n</ul>\n<i>\n</i>Q: Who can see me 'online'?\n<p>The last seen rules apply to your online status as well.\nPeople can only see you online if you're sharing your last seen status with them.</p>\n<p>There are some exceptions because sometimes it is obvious that you are online.\nRegardless of the last seen settings, people will see you online for a brief period (~30 seconds) if you do the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Send them a message in a one-on-one chat or in a group where you both are members.</li>\n<li>Read a message they sent you in a one-on-one chat.</li>\n<li>Broadcast a \u201ctyping\u2026\u201d status to their chat with you or to a group where you both are members.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If you're not sharing your last seen timestamp with someone and don't do anything of the above, they'll never see you online.\nAnother way of achieving this is to block that person.\n</p>\n<i>\n</i>Q: Can I delete my messages?\n<p>Yes.\nPreviously, you could unsend your messages within 48 hours after sending them.\nAs of Telegram 5.5, you can always delete any messages you sent or received in <em>any</em> one-on-one conversation (in groups, it's still your own messages only).\nYou can also clear the entire chat history on both ends.\nOn Telegram, deleted messages do not leave a mark in the chat.</p>\n<p>Together with privacy settings for forwarded messages, this makes exchanging Telegram messages similar to talking face to face (without a tape recorder).\nAs a result, our users no longer need to worry about the data accumulating in their chats over the years.\nBoth parties in a conversation now have full control over what does and what doesn't belong to their online identity.</p>\n<i>\n</i>Q: Can I make calls via Telegram?\n<p>Yes! Voice calls are currently available to users around the world.</p>\n<i>\n</i>Q: How can I use emoticons in Telegram on my iOS device?\n<p>We support emoji emoticons.\nSimply enable the Emoji keyboard in your iOS device's Settings (General &gt.\nKeyboards &gt.\nAdd New Keyboard\u2026 &gt.\nEmoji).\nThen switch to that keyboard whenever you're out of words.</p>\n<i>\n</i>Groups and Channels\n<i>\n</i>Q: What makes Telegram groups cool?\n<p>Telegram groups can have up to <strong>200,000 members</strong> each and are extremely powerful communication tools.\nHere are a few key features that make them stand out in the messaging world: </p>\n<p>\n<strong>Unified history</strong>\n<br>Edit your messages after posting, delete them so that they disappear for everyone.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Cross-platform availability</strong>\n<br>Access your messages anytime, from any number of your mobile or desktop devices.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Instant search</strong>\n<br>Find the message you're looking for, even among millions.\nFilter by sender to make searching easier.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Replies, mentions, hashtags</strong>\n<br>Easily trace a conversation and keep communication efficient, no matter the group size.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Smart notifications</strong>\n<br>Mute the group to get notifications only when people mention you or reply to your messages.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Pinned messages</strong>\n<br>You can pin any message to be displayed at the top of the chat screen.\nAll members will get a notification \u2014 even if they muted ordinary messages from your group.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Moderation tools</strong>\n<br>Appoint administrators that can mass-delete messages, control membership, and pin important messages.\nDefine their admin privileges with granular precision.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Group permissions</strong>\n<br>Set default permissions to restrict all members from posting specific kinds of content.\nOr even restrict members from sending messages altogether \u2013 and let the admins chat amongst themselves while everybody else is watching.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>File sharing</strong>\n<br>Send and receive files of any type, up to 2 GB in size each, access them instantly on your other devices.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Public groups</strong>\n<br>Get a short link for your group and make it public, like t.me/publictestgroup.\nThis way, anybody can view the group's entire chat history and join to post messages.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Customization via bots</strong>\n<br>Create custom tools for any specific needs using our Bot API and Inline Bots.</p>\n<i>\n</i>Q: What's the difference between groups and channels?\n<p>Telegram <strong>groups</strong> are ideal for sharing stuff with friends and family or collaboration in small teams.\nBut groups can also grow very large and support communities of up to 200,000 members.\nYou can make any group <strong>public</strong>, toggle <strong>persistent history</strong> to control whether or not new members have access to earlier messages and appoint <strong>administrators</strong> with granular privileges.\nYou can also pin important messages to the top of the screen so that all members can see them, including those who have just joined.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Channels</strong> are a tool for broadcasting messages to large audiences.\nIn fact, a channel can have an unlimited number of subscribers.\nWhen you post in a channel, the message is signed with the channel's name and photo and not your own.\nEach message in a channel has a <strong>view counter</strong> that gets updated when the message is viewed, including its forwarded copies.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Read more about channels in the Channels FAQ \u00bb</p>\n</blockquote>\n<i>\n</i>Q: How do I create a group?\n<p>\n<em>iOS:</em> Start a new message (tap the icon in the top right corner in Chats) &gt.\n'New Group'.<br>\n<em>Android:</em> Tap the circular pencil icon in the chat list &gt.\n'New Group'.<br>\n<em>Telegram Desktop:</em> Click the menu button in the top left corner &gt.\n'New Group'.</p>\n<i>\n</i>Q: Can I assign administrators?\n<p>You can add administrators to help you manage your group and define their privileges with granular precision.</p>\n<p>\n<em>iOS:</em> Go to Group Info (tap the photo in the top right corner on the group\u2018s chat screen) &gt.\nEdit &gt.\nAdministrators.<br>\n<em>Android:</em> Go to Group Info (tap the name in the header) &gt.\nthe pencil icon (in the top right corner) &gt.\nAdministrators.<br>\n<em>Telegram Desktop:</em> When in the group, click '\u2026' in the top right corner &gt.\nManage group &gt.\nAdministrators.</p>\n<i>\n</i>Q: How do I add more members? What's an invite link?\n<p>You can add your contacts, or using search by username.</p>\n<p>It is easy to migrate existing groups to Telegram by sending people an <strong>invite link</strong>.\nTo create an invite link, go to Group Info &gt.\nAdd Member &gt.\nInvite to Group via Link.</p>\n<p>Anyone who has Telegram installed will be able to join your group by following this link.\nIf you choose to revoke the link, it will stop working immediately.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Read more about invite links in our blog \u00bb</p>\n</blockquote>\n<i>\n</i>Usernames and t.me\n<i>\n</i>Q: What are usernames? How do I get one?\n<p>You can set up a <strong>public</strong> username on Telegram.\nIt then becomes possible for other users to find you by that username \u2014 you will appear in contacts search under 'global results'.\nPlease note that people who find you will be able to send you messages, even if they don't know your number.\nIf you are not comfortable with this, we advise against setting up a username in Telegram.</p>\n<p>You can set up a username in Settings and use the universal search box in the chat list to search for chats, messages, and usernames.</p>\n<i>\n</i>Q: How does t.me work?\n<p>Once you've set up a username, you can give people a t.me/username link.\nOpening that link on their phone will automatically fire up their Telegram app and open a chat with you.\nYou can share username links with friends, write them on business cards or put them up on your website.</p>\n<p>This way people can contact you on Telegram without knowing your phone number.</p>\n<i>\n</i>Q: What can I use as my username?\n<p>You can use a-z, 0-9 and underscores.\nUsernames are case-insensitive, but Telegram will store your capitalization preferences (e.g.\nTelegram and TeleGram is the same user).\nThe username must be at least five characters long.</p>\n<i>\n</i>Q: Do I need a username?\n<p>You don't have to get one.\nRemember that Telegram usernames are public and choosing a username on Telegram makes it possible for people to find you in global search and send you messages even if they don't have your number.\nIf you are not comfortable with this, we advise against setting up a username.</p>\n<i>\n</i>Q: If someone finds me by username, messages and I reply \u2014 will they know my number?\n<p>No.\nNeither party will see another's phone number (unless this is permitted by your privacy settings).\nThis is similar to the case when you message a person who you've met in a Telegram group.</p>\n<i>\n</i>Q: How do I delete my username?\n<p>Go to Settings and save an empty username.\nThis will remove your username.\npeople will no longer be able to find you via search.\nThis will not affect existing conversations.</p>\n<i>\n</i>Q: What do I do if my username is taken?\n<p>Telegram usernames are distributed on a first come \u2014 first serve basis.</p>\n<p>We understand that certain usernames are part of an online identity for some of us.\nIf your desired username is already taken, we will be happy to help you acquire it for your account or channel, provided that you have that same username on at least <strong>two</strong> of these services: Facebook, Twitter, Instagram.</p>\n<p>Due to the fact that one account can register multiple bot and channel usernames, we reserve the right to recall usernames assigned to unused bots and channels, as well as openly squatted usernames.</p>\n<p>To request a username, contact @Username_bot.</p>\n<i>\n</i>Q: What if someone is pretending to be me?\n<p>If a scammer is pretending to be you, please contact @NoToScam.</p>\n<i>\n</i>Security\n<blockquote>\n<p>If you are an advanced user, you may find our FAQ for the Technically Inclined useful as well.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<i>\n</i>Q: How secure is Telegram?\n<p>Telegram is more secure than mass market messengers like WhatsApp and Line.\nWe are based on the MTProto protocol (see description and advanced FAQ), built upon time-tested algorithms to make security compatible with high-speed delivery and reliability on weak connections.\nWe are continuously working with the community to improve the security of our protocol and clients.</p>\n<i>\n</i>Q: What if I\u2019m more paranoid than your regular user?\n<p>We've got you covered.\nTelegram\u2019s special secret chats use end-to-end encryption, leave no trace on our servers, support self-destructing messages and don\u2019t allow forwarding.\nOn top of this, secret chats are not part of the Telegram cloud and can only be accessed on their devices of origin.</p>\n<i>\n</i>Q: So how do you encrypt data?\n<p>We support two layers of secure encryption.\nServer-client encryption is used in Cloud Chats (private and group chats), Secret Chats use an additional layer of client-client encryption.\nAll data, regardless of type, is encrypted in the same way \u2014 be it text, media or files.</p>\n<p>Our encryption is based on 256-bit symmetric AES

decision.\nTelegram supports verifiable builds, which allow experts to independently verify that our code published on GitHub is the <strong>exact same code</strong> that is used to build the apps you download from App Store or Google Play.</p>\n<p>We welcome security experts to audit our system and appreciate any feedback at security@telegram.org.</p>\n<p>On top of that, Telegram's primary focus

Telegram for this to be secure?\n<p>When it comes to secret chats, you don't \u2014 just make sure that the visualized key of your secret chat matches the one in your friend's secret chat settings.\nMore about this below.</p>\n<i>\n</i>Q: What if my hacker friend says they could decipher Telegram messages?\n<p>Anyone who claims that Telegram messages can be deciphered is welcome to prove that claim in our competition and win $300,000.\nYou can check out the Cracking Contest Description to learn more.</p>\n<p>Any comments on Telegram's security are welcome at security@telegram.org.\nAll submissions which result in a change of code or configuration are eligible for bounties, ranging from <strong>$100</strong> to <strong>$100,000</strong> or more, depending on the severity of the issue.\nPlease note that we can not offer bounties for issues that are disclosed to the public before they are fixed.</p>\n<i>\n</i>Q: Can Telegram protect me against everything?\n<p>Telegram can help when it comes to data transfer and secure communication.\nThis means that all data (including media and files) that you send and receive via Telegram cannot be deciphered when intercepted by your internet service provider, owners of Wi-Fi routers you connect to, or other third parties.</p>\n<p>But please remember that we cannot protect you from your own mother if she takes your unlocked phone without a passcode.\nOr from your IT-department if they access your computer at work.\nOr from any other people that get physical or root access to your phones or computers running Telegram.</p>\n<p>If you have reasons to worry about your personal security, we strongly recommend using only Secret Chats in official or at least verifiable open-source apps for sensitive information, preferably with a self-destruct timer.\nWe also recommend enabling 2-Step Verification and setting up a strong passcode to lock your app, you will find both options in Settings &gt.\nPrivacy and Security.</p>\n<i>\n</i>Q: How does 2-Step Verification work?\n<p>Logging in with an SMS code is an industry standard in messaging, but if you're looking for more security or have reasons to doubt your mobile carrier or government, we recommend protecting your cloud chats with an additional password.</p>\n<p>You can do this in <strong>Settings &gt.\nPrivacy and Security &gt.\n2-Step Verification</strong>.\nOnce enabled, you will need both an SMS code and a password to log in.\nYou can also set up a recovery email address that will help regain access, should you forget your password.\nIf you do so, please remember that it's important that the recovery email account is also protected with a strong password and 2-Step Verification when possible.</p>\n<p>Check this out for tips on creating a strong password that is easy to remember.</p>\n<i>\n</i>Q: Why can jailbroken and rooted devices be dangerous?\n<p>Using a rooted or jailbroken device makes it easier for a potential attacker to gain full administrative control over your device \u2014 root access.</p>\n<p>A user with root access can easily bypass security features built into the operating system, read process memory or access restricted areas, such as the internal storage.\nOnce an attacker has root access, any efforts to mitigate threats become futile.\nNo application can be called safe under these circumstances, no matter how strong the encryption.</p>\n<i>\n</i>Secret Chats\n<i>\n</i>Q: How are secret chats different?\n<p>Secret chats are meant for people who want more secrecy than the average fella.\nAll messages in secret chats use end-to-end encryption.\nThis means only you and the recipient can read those messages \u2014 nobody else can decipher them, including us here at Telegram (more on this here).\nOn top of this, Messages cannot be forwarded from secret chats.\nAnd when you delete messages on your side of the conversation, the app on the other side of the secret chat will be ordered to delete them as well.</p>\n<p>You can order your messages, photos, videos and files to self-destruct in a set amount of time after they have been read or opened by the recipient.\nThe message will then disappear from both your and your friend's devices.</p>\n<p>All secret chats in Telegram are device-specific and are not part of the Telegram cloud.\nThis means you can only access messages in a secret chat from their device of origin.\nThey are safe for as long as your device is safe in your pocket.</p>\n<i>\n</i>Q: How do I start a secret chat?\n<p>\n<em>iOS:</em> Open the profile of the user you want to contact.\nTap on \u2018\u2026\u2019, then \u2018Start Secret Chat\u2019.<br>\n<em>Android:</em> Swipe right to open the menu, then 'New secret chat'.</p>\n<p>Remember that Telegram secret chats are device-specific.\nIf you start a secret chat with a friend on one of your devices, this chat will only be available on that device.\nIf you log out, you will lose all your secret chats.\nYou can create as many different secret chats with the same contact as you like.</p>\n<i>\n</i>Q: How do self-destructing messages work?\n<p>The Self-Destruct Timer is available for <strong>all messages</strong> in Secret Chats and for <strong>media</strong> in private cloud chats.</p>\n<p>To set the timer, simply tap the clock icon (in the input field on iOS, top bar on Android), and then choose the desired time limit.\nThe clock starts ticking the moment the message is displayed on the recipient's screen (gets two check marks).\nAs soon as the time runs out, the message disappears from <strong>both</strong> devices.\nWe will try to send a notification if a screenshot is taken.</p>\n<p>Please note that the timer in Secret Chats only applies to messages that were sent <strong>after</strong> the timer was set.\nIt has no effect on earlier messages.</p>\n<i>\n</i>Q: Can I be certain that my conversation partner doesn't take a screenshot?\n<p>Unfortunately, there is no bulletproof way of detecting screenshots on certain systems (most notably, some Android and Windows Phone devices).\nWe will make every effort to alert you about screenshots taken in your Secret Chats, but it may still be possible to bypass such notifications and take screenshots silently.\nWe advise to share sensitive information only with people you trust.\nAfter all, nobody can stop a person from taking a picture of their screen with a different device or an old school camera.</p>\n<i>\n</i>Q: What is this 'Encryption Key' thing?\n<p>When a secret chat is created, the participating devices exchange encryption keys using the so-called Diffie-Hellman key exchange.\nAfter the secure end-to-end connection has been established, we generate a picture that visualizes the encryption key for your chat.\nYou can then compare this image with the one your friend has \u2014 if the two images are the same, you can be sure that the secret chat is secure, and no man-in-the-middle attack can succeed.</p>\n<p>Newer versions of Telegram apps will show a larger picture along with a textual representation of the key (this is not the key itself, of course!) when both participants are using an updated app.</p>\n<p>Always compare visualizations using a channel that is known to be secure \u2014 it's safest if you do this in person, in an offline meeting with the conversation partner.</p>\n<i>\n</i>Q: Why not just make all chats 'secret'?\n<p>All Telegram messages are always securely encrypted.\nMessages in Secret Chats use <strong>client-client</strong> encryption, while Cloud Chats use <strong>client-server/server-client</strong> encryption and are stored encrypted in the Telegram Cloud (more here).\nThis enables your cloud messages to be both secure and immediately accessible from any of your devices \u2013 even if you lose your device altogether.</p>\n<p>The problem of restoring access to your chat history on a newly connected device (e.g.\nwhen you lose your phone) does not have an elegant solution in the end-to-end encryption paradigm.\nAt the same time, reliable backups are an essential feature for any mass-market messenger.\nTo solve this problem, some applications (like Whatsapp and Viber) allow decryptable backups that put their users' privacy at risk \u2013 even if they do not enable backups themselves.\nOther apps ignore the need for backups altogether and fade into oblivion before ever reaching a million users.</p>\n<p>We opted for a third approach by offering two distinct types of chats.\nTelegram disables default system backups and provides all users with an integrated security-focused backup solution in the form of Cloud Chats.\nMeanwhile, the separate entity of Secret Chats gives you full control over the data you do not want to be stored.</p>\n<p>This allows Telegram to be widely adopted in broad circles, not just by activists and dissidents, so that the simple fact of using Telegram does not mark users as targets for heightened surveillance in certain countries.\nWe are convinced that the separation of conversations into Cloud and Secret chats represents the most secure solution currently possible for a massively popular messaging application.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>See also: Why Telegram isn't End-to-End Encrypted \u201cby Default\u201d</p>\n</blockquote>\n<i>\n</i>Your Account\n<i>\n</i>Q: Who can see my phone number?\n<p>On Telegram, you can send messages in private chats and groups without making your phone number visible.\nBy default, your number is only visible to people who you've added to your address book as contacts.\nYou can further modify this in <em>Settings &gt.\nPrivacy and Security &gt.\nPhone Number</em>.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Note that people will always see your number if they know it already and <strong>saved</strong> it in their address book.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<i>\n</i>Q: I have a new phone number, what do I do?\n<p>Each phone number is a <strong>separate</strong> account on Telegram.\nYou have several options if you are using multiple phone numbers:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>If you will <strong>no longer use the old number</strong> (e.g., you moved to a new country or changed your number for good), simply go to Settings and change the number connected to your Telegram account to the new number.\n<strong>Important:</strong> make sure you have access to your connected phone number \u2013 otherwise you risk losing access to your account.</li>\n<li>If you will use the new number for a <strong>limited time</strong> (e.g., you're on a trip or vacation), there's no need to do anything.</li>\n<li>If you want to keep using <strong>both numbers</strong> (e.g., you have a work phone and personal phone), choose one as your Telegram number.\nYou <em>may</em> create another Telegram account on the second number as well, for example, if you want to keep work and personal chats separated.\nIt is possible to log in to one Telegram app with up to <strong>3</strong> different accounts at once.</li>\n</ul>\n<i>\n</i>Q: How do I log out?\n<p>Most users don't need to log out of Telegram:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>You can use Telegram on many devices <strong>at the same time</strong>.\nJust use the same phone number to log in on all devices.</li>\n<li>You can go to <em>Settings &gt.\nData and Storage &gt.\nStorage Usage&gt.\nClear cache</em> to <strong>free up space</strong> on your device without logging out.</li>\n<li>If you use Telegram with <strong>multiple phone numbers</strong>, you can switch between accounts without logging out.</li>\n<li>If you use Telegram on a <strong>shared device</strong>, you can set up a passcode in <em>Settings &gt.\nPrivacy and Security</em> to make sure only you have access to your account.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If you do want to log out for some reason, here's how you do that:</p>\n<p>\n<em>iOS</em>: Go to Settings &gt.\nEdit &gt.\nLog out.<br>\n<em>Android</em>, <em>Telegram Desktop</em>: Go to Settings &gt.\n\u2026 (in the top right corner) &gt.\nLog out.</p>\n<p>If you log out, you will keep all your cloud messages.\nHowever, you <strong>will lose</strong> all your <strong>Secret Chats</strong> and <strong>all messages</strong> inside those secret chats when you log out.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Note that logging out does <strong>not</strong> trigger remote deletion of your secret chat messages on your partner's device \u2014 to do that, choose 'Clear History' first.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<i>\n</i>Q: How do I change my phone number?\n<p>You can change your number in Telegram and keep <strong>everything</strong>, including all your contacts, messages, and media from the Telegram cloud, as well as all your Secret Chats on all devices.</p>\n<p>To change your number, go to Settings, then tap on your phone number (just above the username), then 'Change Number'.\nIf you already have a different Telegram account on the target number, you'll need to delete that account first.</p>\n<i>\n</i>Q: How do I delete my account?\n<p>If you would like to delete your account, you can do this on the deactivation page.\nDeleting your account permanently removes all your <strong>messages</strong> and <strong>contacts</strong>.\nAll groups and channels that you've created are orphaned and left without a creator but admins retain their rights.</p>\n<p>This action must be confirmed via your Telegram account and cannot be undone.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>We recommend using a non-mobile browser for this process.<br>Note that you'll receive the <strong>code</strong> via <strong>Telegram</strong>, not SMS.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<i>\n</i>Q: What happens if I delete my account?\n<p>As was just mentioned above, all your data will be flushed from our system: all messages, groups, and contacts associated with your account will be deleted.\nThat said, your contacts will still be able to chat in the groups that you have created, and they will still have <em>their</em> copy of the messages you sent them.\nSo if you want to send messages that can vanish without a trace, try using our self-destruct timer instead.</p>\n<p>Termination of a Telegram account is irreversible.\nIf you sign up again, you will appear as a new user and will not get your history, contacts or groups back.\nPeople, who have your phone number in their contacts, will be notified.\nThe new user will be displayed as a separate conversation in their messages list and their conversation history with this new user will be empty.</p>\n<i>\n</i>Q: How does account self-destruction work?\n<p>Telegram is not a commercial organization, and we value our disk space greatly.\nIf you stop using Telegram and don't come online for at least six months, your account will be deleted along with all messages, media, contacts and every other piece of data you store in the Telegram cloud.\nYou can change the exact period after which your inactive account will self-destruct in Settings.</p>\n<i>\n</i>Q: My phone was stolen, what do I do?\n<p>First of all, sorry about your phone.\nUnfortunately, the phone number is the only way for us to identify a Telegram user at the moment.\nWe don't collect additional information about you, so whoever has the number, has the account.\nThis means we can't help you unless you have access either to the phone number or to Telegram itself on any of your devices.</p>\n<i>\n</i>I have access to Telegram on another device\n<ol>\n<li>Go to Telegram Settings &gt.\nPrivacy and Security and turn on Two-Step Verification.\nThis way the phone number alone will not be enough to log in to your account.</li>\n<li>Go to Settings &gt.\nDevices (or Privacy &amp.\nSecurity &gt.\nActive Sessions) and terminate your Telegram session on the old device.\nWhoever has your phone will not be able to log in again, since they don't know your password.</li>\n<li>Contact your phone provider, so that they block your old SIM and issue a new one with your number.</li>\n<li>If you decide to switch to a new phone number, don't forget to go to Settings, tap on your phone number and change your Telegram number to the new one.</li>\n</ol>\n<i>\n</i>I don't have access to Telegram on any other devices\n<ol>\n<li>First and foremost, you need to contact your phone provider, so that they block your old SIM and issue a new one with your number.</li>\n<li>Wait till you receive your new SIM with the old number, log in to Telegram, then go to Settings &gt.\nDevices (or Privacy &amp.\nSecurity &gt.\nActive Sessions) and terminate your Telegram session on the old device.</li>\n</ol>\n<i>\n</i>Removing sensitive data\n<p>Common thieves usually throw out the SIM card immediately (the phone is harder to locate this way), then wipe the devices and sell them, so there isn't much risk for the data in case of regular petty theft.\nBut if you have reasons to worry about the data on the device and are unable to log out the other device, it is best that you wipe it remotely.\nYou can read more about it here: Apple iOS, Android.\nUnfortunately, this requires you to have prepared in advance for this scenario.</p>\n<p>You can delete your Telegram account if you are logged in on at least one of your other devices (mobile or desktop).\nNote that inactive Telegram accounts self-destruct automatically after a period of time \u2014 6 months being the default setting.</p>\n<i>\n</i>Bots\n<blockquote>\n<p>If you're a developer, you may find our Bots FAQ more useful.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<i>\n</i>Q: What are bots?\n<p>Bots are like small programs that run right inside Telegram.\nThey are made by third-party developers using the Telegram Bot API.</p>\n<i>\n</i>Q: How do I create a bot?\n<p>Creating Telegram bots is super-easy, but you will need at least some skills in computer programming.\nIf you're sure you're up to it, our <strong>Introduction for Developers</strong> is a good place to start.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, there are no out-of-the-box ways to create a working bot if you are not a developer.\nBut we're sure you'll soon find plenty of bots created by other people to play with.</p>\n<i>\n</i>Q: A bot is sending me messages, how do I make it stop?\n<p>If you don't want a bot to send you messages, feel free to block it \u2013 same as you would block a human user.\nSome Telegram clients have a 'Stop Bot' button right in the bot's profile.</p>\n<p>That said, most bot developers offer commands that silence the bot, check its <em>/help</em> for clues.</p>\n<i>\n</i>Q: Are bots safe?\n<p>Yes.\nBots are no different from human users that you meet in groups for example.\nThey can see your public name, username, and profile pictures, and they can see messages you send to them, that's it.\nThey can't access your last seen status and <strong>don't</strong> see your phone number (unless you decide to give it to them yourself).</p>\n<p>Naturally, any bot should be treated as a stranger \u2014 don't give them your passwords, Telegram codes or bank account numbers, even if they ask nicely.\nAlso, be careful when opening files sent by bots, same as you would deal with ordinary humans.\nExample: If a bot sent us a file called <em>OpenMe.exe</em>, we probably wouldn't open it.</p>\n<i>\n</i>Q: If I add a bot to my group, can it read my messages?\n<p>Bots can work in two modes when you add them to groups.\nBy default, bots only see messages that are meant for them.\nIn this case, you'll see 'has no access to messages' in the group members list next to the bot.</p>\n<p>Some bots need more information to work, so developers may disable the privacy mode.\nIn this case, the bot will see all messages sent to the group, and you will see 'has access to messages' in the members list next to the bot.</p>\n<p>Learn more about privacy mode for bots \u00bb</p>\n<p>If your group contains very sensitive information, maybe it's better to avoid adding bots you don't trust 100%.</p>\n<i>\n</i>Q: Are bots made by Telegram?\n<p>No.\nWhile we have some official bots for specific purposes (like @gif or @GDPRbot), we don't usually make bots.\nBots are made by third-party developers using the Telegram Bot API and platform.</p>\n<i>\n</i>Q: Where can I find more bots?\n<p>There is no official store at the moment, so you'll have to ask your friends or search the web for now.\nWe're pretty sure you'll find some bots to play with.</p>\n<i>\n</i>Deeper questions\n<i>\n</i>Q: Why not open source everything?\n<p>All code will be released eventually.\nWe started with the most useful parts \u2014 a well-documented API that allows developers to build new Telegram apps, and open source clients that can be verified by security specialists.</p>\n<i>\n</i>Q: Can I run Telegram using my own server?\n<p>Our architecture does not support federation yet.\nTelegram is a unified cloud service, so creating forks where two users might end up on two different Telegram clouds is unacceptable.\nTo enable you to run your own Telegram server while retaining both speed and security is a task in itself.\nAt the moment, we are undecided on whether or not Telegram should go in this direction.</p>\n<i>\n</i>Q: Can I use the Telegram API?\n<p>Yes.\nDevelopers for all platforms are welcome to use our protocol, API and even source code.\nCheck out the Getting started section of the docs.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Don't forget about our Bot API that lets you build cool stuff on our platform.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<i>\n</i>Q: Do you have a Privacy Policy?\n<p>Sure.\nCheck this out.</p>\n<i>\n</i>Q: Why do you have two apps in the Mac App Store?\n<p>One is our app for macOS, the other is Telegram Lite, the macOS version of our multi-platform client.\nBoth apps are official.\nBoth started out as unofficial applications by two different developers and vary in design and functionality.</p>\n<p>Telegram for macOS supports many platform-specific features, such as the MacBook Pro Touch Bar, gesture navigation, integration with the Mac's Share menu and more.\nIt has every feature from the iOS version of the app including Secret Chats.</p>\n<p>Telegram Lite is a lightning-fast app, optimized for work-related tasks and handling large communities.\nIt offers a three-column interface, perfect for multitasking and quick access to media, files and links shared in your chats.\nThis app can also be used to export your Telegram data and chats.</p>\n<i>\n</i>Q: Can I translate Telegram?\n<p>Telegram is officially available in English, Spanish, German, Dutch, Italian, French, Arabic, Portuguese, Korean, Malay, Russian and Ukrainian on most platforms, and we are gradually expanding the list of languages built into the apps.</p>\n<p>If you don\u2019t like how a specific element in Telegram's interface is translated in your language, or would like to help us maintain the translation, check out our localization platform.\nEveryone can suggest translations and vote for the best ones, making Telegram localization a

Passport, you can upload your documents once, then instantly share your data with services that require real-world ID (finance, ICOs, etc.).</p>\n<p>Your identity documents and personal data will be stored in the Telegram cloud using <strong>End-to-End Encryption</strong>.\nTo Telegram, this data is just random gibberish, and we have no access to the information you store in your Telegram Passport.\nWhen you share data, it goes directly to the recipient.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>You can find more information about Telegram Passport on our blog.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>If you're a developer

names.</p>\n<p>\n<em>Android:</em>\n</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Make sure you are using the latest version of the app.</li>\n<li>Relaunch the app (by terminating it from processes list and launching again).</li>\n<li>Temporarily change the name of the contact in phone contacts (add a few symbols, then change back again).</li>\n<li>If that didn't help, re-login.\nRemember that logging out kills

profile photo in the top area of the chat screen, then tap on '\u2026' in the top right corner &gt.\n'Delete'.</p>\n<p>If you want to delete the contact completely, make sure you also delete them from your phone contacts.\nTelegram stays in sync and will add the contact back if you don't.</p>\n<i>\n</i>Where did my Secret Chat messages go?\n<p>Secret Chats are established between the two devices they were created on.\nThis means that all those messages are not available in the cloud and cannot be accessed on other devices.</p>\n<p>Moreover, Secret Chats are also tied to your current login session on the device.\nIf you log out and in again, you will lose all your Secret Chats.</p>\n<i>\n</i>Can't send messages to non-contacts\n<p>When users report unwanted messages from a Telegram account, we apply a limit: Reported accounts can only send messages to people who have their number saved as a contact.</p>\n<p>This means that if you randomly contact people you don't know and send them annoying messages, you may lose the ability to do so in the future.</p>\n<p>If you think that this limit was applied to your account wrongly, please visit this page.</p>\n<i>\n</i>Telegram uses the camera or microphone in the background!\n<p>Telegram can use the <strong>microphone</strong> in the background if you minimize the app when making a call, recording a video, or recording a voice/video message.</p>\n<p>Permission monitors on Samsung and Xiaomi can inadvertently flag and notify you that Telegram requested access to <strong>camera</strong> in the background.\nThis happens when the app requests info about the camera \u2014 it isn\u2019t using the camera.\nUnfortunately it may look the same to the Samsung and Xiaomi permission monitors.</p>\n<p>Camera info is requested by the app when you tap on the attachment button, or start recording a video or a video message.\nIf you do this and quickly close the app, the already initiated request may try to run asynchronously when the app is already in the background, or be sent when the system wakes up the app to show a notification about a new message.\nIn any case, these requests are only for the camera info, the app <em>never</em> uses the camera itself in the background.</p>\n<p>Anyone can check Telegram\u2019s open source code and confirm that the app is not doing anything behind their back.\nWe also offer

sets out how we, Telegram Messenger Inc.\n<strong>(\u201cTelegram\u201d)</strong>, use and protect your personal data that you provide to us, or that is otherwise obtained or generated by us, in connection with your use of our cloud-based messaging services (the <strong>\u201cServices\u201d</strong>).\nFor the purposes of this Privacy Policy, <strong>\u2018we\u2019</strong>, <strong>\u2018us\u2019</strong> and <strong>\u2018our\u2019</strong> refers to Telegram, and <strong>\u2018you\u2019</strong> refers to you, the user of the Services.</p>\n<i>\n</i>1.1 Privacy Principles\n<p>Telegram has two fundamental principles when it comes to collecting and processing private data:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>We don't use your data to show you ads.</li>\n<li>We only store the data that Telegram needs to function as a secure and feature-rich messaging service.</li>\n</ul>\n<i>\n</i>1.2.\nTerms of Service\n<p>This Privacy Policy forms part of our Terms of Service, which describes the terms under which you use our Services and which are available at <strong>https://telegram.org/tos</strong>.\nThis Privacy Policy should therefore be read in conjunction with those terms.</p>\n<i>\n</i>1.3.\nTable of Contents\n<p>This Privacy Policy explains the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>the legal basis for processing your personal data;</li>\n<li>what personal data we may collect from you;</li>\n<li>how we keep your personal data safe;</li>\n<li>what we may use your personal data for;</li>\n<li>who your personal data may be shared with.\nand </li>\n<li>your rights regarding your personal data.</li>\n</ul>\n<i>\n</i>1.4.\nEEA Representative\n<p>If you live in a country in the European Economic Area (EEA), the Services are provided by Telegram, which for the purposes of applicable data protection legislation is the data controller responsible for your personal data when you use our Services.\nHowever, as Telegram is located outside the EEA, we have designated one of our EEA-based group companies, Telegram UK Holdings Ltd (71-75 Shelton Street, Covent Garden, London, England, WC2H 9JQ), as a representative to whom you may direct any issues you have relating to our processing of your personal data.\n</p>\n<i>\n</i>2.\nLegal Ground for Processing Your Personal Data\n<p>We process your personal data on the ground that such processing is necessary to further our legitimate interests (including: <em>(1)</em> providing effective and innovative Services to our users.\nand <em>(2)</em> to detect, prevent or otherwise address fraud or security issues in respect of our provision of Services), unless those interests are overridden by your interest or fundamental rights and freedoms that require protections of personal data.</p>\n<i>\n</i>3.\nWhat Personal Data We Use\n<i>\n</i>3.1.\nBasic Account Data\n<p>Telegram is a communication service.\nYou provide your mobile number and basic account data (which may include profile name, profile picture and about information) to create a Telegram account.</p>\n<p>To make it easier for your contacts and other people to reach you and recognize who you are, the screen name you choose, your profile pictures, and your username (should you choose to set one) on Telegram are always public.\nWe don't want to know your real name, gender, age or what you like.\n</p>\n<p>We do <strong>not</strong> require your screen name to be your real name.\nNote that users who have you in their contacts will see you by the name they saved and not by your screen name.\nThis way your mother can have the public name 'Johnny Depp' while appearing as 'Mom' to you and as 'Boss' to her underlings at work (or the other way around, depending on how these relationships are structured).</p>\n<i>\n</i>3.2.\nYour E-mail Address\n<p>When you enable 2-step-verification for your account or store documents using the Telegram Passport feature, you can opt to set up a password recovery email.\nThis address will only be used to send you a password recovery code if you forget it.\nThat's right: no marketing or \u201cwe miss you\u201d bullshit.</p>\n<i>\n</i>3.3.\nYour Messages\n<i>\n</i>3.3.1.\nCloud Chats\n<p>Telegram is a cloud service.\nWe store messages, photos, videos and documents from your <em>cloud chats</em> on our servers so that you can access your data from any of your devices anytime without having to rely on third-party backups.\nAll data is stored heavily encrypted and the encryption keys in each case are stored in several other data centers in different jurisdictions.\nThis way local engineers or physical intruders cannot get access to user data.</p>\n<i>\n</i>3.3.2.\nSecret Chats\n<p>\n<em>Secret chats</em> use end-to-end encryption.\nThis means that all data is encrypted with a key that only you and the recipient know.\nThere is <strong>no way</strong> for us or anybody else without direct access to your device to learn what content is being sent in those messages.\nWe do not store your secret chats on our servers.\nWe also do not keep any logs for messages in secret chats, so after a short period of time we no longer know who or when you messaged via secret chats.\nFor the same reasons secret chats are not available in the cloud \u2014 you can only access those messages from the device they were sent <em>to</em> or <em>from</em>.</p>\n<i>\n</i>3.3.3.\nMedia in Secret Chats\n<p>When you send photos, videos or files via secret chats, before being uploaded, each item is encrypted with a separate key, not known to the server.\nThis key and the file\u2019s location are then encrypted again, this time with the secret chat\u2019s key \u2014 and sent to your recipient.\nThey can then download and decipher the file.\nThis means that the file is technically on one of Telegram\u2019s servers, but it looks like a piece of random indecipherable garbage to everyone except for you and the recipient.\nWe don\u2019t know what this random data stands for and we have no idea which particular chat it belongs to.\nWe periodically purge this random data from our servers to save disk space.</p>\n<i>\n</i>3.3.4.\nPublic Chats\n<p>In addition to private messages, Telegram also supports public channels and public groups.\nAll public chats are cloud chats (see section 3.3.1 above).\nLike everything on Telegram, the data you post in public communities is encrypted, both in storage and in transit \u2014 but everything you post in public will be accessible to everyone.</p>\n<i>\n</i>3.3.5.\nPhone Number and Contacts\n<p>Telegram uses phone numbers as unique identifiers so that it is easy for you to switch from SMS and other messaging apps and retain your social graph.\nWe ask your permission before syncing your contacts.</p>\n<p>We store your up-to-date contacts in order to notify you as soon as one of your contacts signs up for Telegram and to properly display names in notifications.\nWe only need the number and name (first and last) for this to work and store no other data about your contacts.</p>\n<p>Our automatic algorithms can also use anonymized sets of phone numbers to calculate the average number of potential contacts an unregistered phone number may have on Telegram.\nWhen you open the 'Invite friends' interface, we display the resulting statistics next to your contacts to give you an idea of who could benefit most from joining Telegram.\n</p>\n<p>You can always stop syncing contacts or delete them from our servers in Settings &gt.\nPrivacy &amp.\nSecurity &gt.\nData Settings.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>If you are using Android, Telegram will ask you for permission to access your phone call logs (READ_CALL_LOG).\nIf you grant this permission, Telegram will be able verify your account by transmitting a phone call instead of asking you to enter a code.\nTelegram uses this permission only to confirm receipt of the confirmation call by verifying the number in the call log.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<i>\n</i>3.3.6.\nCookies\n<p>The only cookies we use are those to operate and provide our Services on the web.\nWe do not use cookies for profiling or advertising.\nThe cookies we use are small text files that allow us to provide and customize our Services, and in doing so provide you with an enhanced user experience.\nYour browser should allow you to control these cookies, including whether or not to accept them and how to remove them.\nYou may choose to block cookies with your web browser, however, if you do disable these cookies you will not be able to log in to Telegram Web.</p>\n<i>\n</i>4.\nKeeping Your Personal Data Safe\n<i>\n</i>4.1.\nStoring Data\n<p>If you signed up for Telegram from the UK or the EEA, your data is stored in data centers in the Netherlands.\nThese are third-party provided data centers in which Telegram rents a designated space.\nHowever, the servers and networks that sit inside these data centers and on which your personal data is stored are owned by Telegram.\nAs such, we do not share your personal data with such data centers.\nAll data is stored heavily encrypted so that local Telegram engineers or physical intruders cannot get access.</p>\n<i>\n</i>4.2.\nEnd-to-End Encrypted Data\n<p>Your messages, media and files from secret chats (see section 3.3.2 above), as well as the contents of your calls and the data you store in your Telegram Passport are processed only on your device and on the device of your recipient.\nBefore this data reaches our servers, it is encrypted with a key known only to you and the recipient.\nWhile Telegram servers will handle this end-to-end encrypted data to deliver it to the recipient \u2013 or store it in the case of Telegram Passport data, we have no ways of deciphering the actual information.\nIn this case, we neither store nor process your personal data, rather we store and process random sequences of symbols that have no meaning without the keys which we don\u2019t have.</p>\n<i>\n</i>4.3.\nRetention\n<p>Unless stated otherwise in this Privacy Policy, the personal data that you provide us will only be stored for as long as it is necessary for us to fulfill our obligations in respect of the provision of the Services.</p>\n<i>\n</i>5.\nProcessing Your Personal Data\n<i>\n</i>5.1.\nOur Services\n<p>Telegram is a cloud service.\nWe will process your data to deliver your cloud chat history, including messages, media and files, to any devices of your choosing without a need for you to use third-party backups or cloud storage.</p>\n<i>\n</i>5.2.\nSafety and Security\n<p>Telegram supports massive communities which we have to police against abuse and Terms of Service violations.\nTelegram also has more than 400 million users which makes it a lucrative target for spammers.\nTo improve the security of your account, as well as to prevent spam, abuse, and other violations of our Terms of Service, we may collect metadata such as your IP address, devices and Telegram apps you've used, history of username changes, etc.\nIf collected, this metadata can be kept for 12 months maximum.</p>\n<i>\n</i>5.3.\nSpam and Abuse\n<p>To prevent phishing, spam and other kinds of abuse and violations of Telegram\u2019s Terms of Service, our moderators may check messages that were reported to them by their recipients.\nIf a spam report on a message you sent is confirmed by our moderators, your account may be limited from contacting strangers \u2013 temporarily or permanently.\nYou can send an appeal using @Spambot.\nIn case of more serious violations, your account may be banned.\nWe may also use automated algorithms to analyze messages in cloud chats to stop spam and phishing.</p>\n<i>\n</i>5.4.\nCross-Device Functionality\n<p>We may also store some aggregated metadata to create Telegram features (see section 5.5 below) that work across all your devices.</p>\n<i>\n</i>5.5.\nAdvanced features\n<p>We may use some aggregated data about how you use Telegram to build useful features.\nFor example, when you open the Search menu, Telegram displays the people you are more likely to message in a box at the top of the screen.\nTo do this, we calculate a rating that shows which people you message frequently.\nA similar rating is calculated for inline bots so that the app can suggest the bots you are most likely to use in the attachment menu (or when you start a new message with \u201c@\u201d).\nTo turn this feature off and delete the relevant data, go to Settings &gt.\nPrivacy &amp.\nSecurity &gt.\nData Settings and disable \u201cSuggest Frequent Contacts\u201d.</p>\n<i>\n</i>5.6.\nNo Ads\n<p>Unlike other services, we don't use your data for ad targeting or other commercial purposes.\nTelegram only stores the information it needs to function as a secure and feature-rich cloud service.\n</p>\n<i>\n</i>6.\nBot Messages\n<i>\n</i>6.1.\nEcosystem\n<p>Telegram has an API that allows third-party developers to create bots.\nBots are apps that look like special Telegram users: you can talk to them from your chat list, add them to groups or use a special \u201cinline\u201d interface to access their features.\nBy performing any of these actions, you will be sending some of your data to the respective third-party bot developers.</p>\n<i>\n</i>6.2.\nHow Bots Can Receive Data\n<p>You can send data to bot developers when you interact with their bots in one of these ways:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>By sending messages to a bot.</li>\n<li>By using an inline bot.</li>\n<li>By participating in a group with a bot.</li>\n<li>By pressing buttons in messages sent by a bot.</li>\n<li>By paying for goods and services via bots (see section 7 below).</li>\n</ul>\n<i>\n</i>6.3.\nWhat Data Bots Receive\n<p>In any of the above cases, the developers of an automated user (bot) can get your public account data (see section 3.1 above): your screen name, username and profile picture(s).</p>\n<p>Bots can also receive the following data when you <strong>interact</strong> with them.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Bots will obviously get your messages when you send them something.</li>\n<li>If you click on links or buttons provided by the bot, the bot can potentially get your IP address (provided that it controls the website to which the link leads).\n</li>\n<li>If the bot is a member of the same group with you, it may know you are a member.</li>\n<li>When you start your message with the username of an inline bot (e.g.\n@gif) the interface transforms so that everything you type becomes a query to that bot.\nThis query is sent to the bot so that it can provide its service.\nWe will warn you about this the first time you use an inline bot.</li>\n<li>Bots added to groups can operate in two modes: with access to messages in the group or without access.\nIf the bot has access to messages, it can see everything that happens in the group.\nThe interface clearly shows whether or not a bot has access to messages in groups.</li>\n</ul>\n<i>\n</i>6.4.\nBots Are Not Maintained by Telegram\n<p>Other than our own bots, no other bots or third-party bot developers are affiliated with Telegram.\nThey are completely independent from us.\nThey should ask you for your permission before they access your data or you make it available to them.</p>\n<i>\n</i>7.\nThird Party Payment Services\n<i>\n</i>7.1.\nPayment Information\n<p>The Payment Platform for Bots is available to users as of Telegram 4.0.\nTelegram does not process payments from users and instead relies on different payment providers around the world.\nIt is the payment providers that handle and store your credit card details.\nNeither Telegram nor the merchants on the platform (bot developers) have access to this information.\nAlthough we work with payment providers they are completely independent from Telegram.\nPlease study their relevant privacy policies before making your data available to them.\n</p>\n<i>\n</i>7.2.\nCredit Card Information\n<p>When making a purchase, you enter your credit card details into a form supplied by the payment provider that will be processing the payment, and this information goes directly to the payment provider's server.\nYour credit card information never reaches Telegram's servers.\nWe do not access and do not store your credit card information.\nWhen you save your credit card info, it is saved on the respective payment provider's servers and the payment provider gives Telegram a <em>token</em> that you can reuse for future payments.\nIt is not possible to reconstruct your credit card info from the token.</p>\n<i>\n</i>7.3 Shipping Information\n<p>When you enter shipping information in the process of placing an order, we send it directly to the merchant bot developer.\nWe can store your shipping information for you if you choose to save it for future purchases.\nWe will delete this information immediately if you ask us to.</p>\n<i>\n</i>7.4.\nClearing Payment Information\n<p>You can clear all payment information associated with your account at any time by going to Telegram Settings &gt.\nPrivacy &amp.\nSecurity &gt.\nData Settings and selecting \u2018Clear Payment &amp.\nShipping Info\u2019.\nIf you choose to remove your payment information, we will delete your stored shipping info and payment tokens from all providers and ask the payment providers to remove your credit card information that they store.</p>\n<i>\n</i>7.5.\nPayment Disputes\n<p>Due to the fact that Telegram doesn't store any credit card details or transaction information, it is impossible for us to handle complaints or cashbacks \u2013 any disputed payments are the responsibility of the bot developers, payment providers, and banks that participated in the exchange.</p>\n<i>\n</i>8.\nWho Your Personal Data May Be Shared With\n<i>\n</i>8.1.\nOther Telegram Users\n<p>Other users of our Services with whom you choose to communicate with and share certain information, who may be located outside the EEA.\nNote that by entering into the Terms of Service and choosing to communicate with such other users of Telegram, you are instructing us to transfer your personal data, on your behalf, to those users in accordance with this Privacy Policy.\nWe employ all appropriate technical and organizational measures (including encryption of your personal data) to ensure a level of security for your personal data that is appropriate to the risk.\n</p>\n<i>\n</i>8.2.\nTelegram\u2019s Group Companies\n<p>We may share your personal data with: <em>(1)</em> our parent company, Telegram Group Inc, located in the British Virgin Islands.\nand <em>(2)</em> Telegram FZ-LLC, a group member located in Dubai, to help provide, improve and support our Services.\nWe will implement appropriate safeguards to protect the security and integrity of that personal data.\nThis will take the form of standard contract clauses approved by the European Commission in an agreement between us and our relevant group companies.\nIf you would like more information regarding these clauses, please contact us using the details in section 12 below.</p>\n<i>\n</i>8.3.\nLaw Enforcement Authorities\n<p>If Telegram receives a court order that confirms you're a terror suspect, we may disclose your IP address and phone number to the relevant authorities.\nSo far, this has never happened.\nWhen it does, we will include it in a semiannual transparency report published at: https://t.me/transparency.</p>\n<i>\n</i>9.\nYour Rights Regarding the Personal Data You Provide to Us\n<i>\n</i>9.1.\nYour Rights\n<p>Under applicable data protection legislation, in certain circumstances, you have rights concerning your personal data.\nYou have a right to: <em>(1)</em> request a copy of all your personal data that we store and to transmit that copy to another data controller.\n<em>(2)</em> delete (see section 10 below) or amend your personal data.\n<em>(3)</em> restrict, or object to, the processing of your personal data.\n<em>(4)</em> correct any inaccurate or incomplete personal data we hold on you.\nand <em>(5)</em> lodge a complaint with national data protection authorities regarding our processing of your personal data.</p>\n<i>\n</i>9.2.\nExercising Your Rights\n<p>If you wish to exercise any of these rights, kindly contact us using the details in section 12 below.</p>\n<i>\n</i>9.3.\nData Settings\n<p>You can control how your data is used (e.g., delete synced contacts) in <em>Settings &gt.\nPrivacy &amp.\nSecurity &gt.\nData Settings</em> (using one of our mobile apps).\n</p>\n<p>Sadly, if you're generally not OK with Telegram's modest requirements, it won't be possible for us to provide you with our Services.\nYou can delete your Telegram account by proceeding to the deactivation page.</p>\n<i>\n</i>10.\nDeleting data\n<i>\n</i>10.1.\nAccounts\n<p>If you would like to delete your account, you can do this on the deactivation page.\nDeleting your account removes all messages, media, contacts and every other piece of data you store in the Telegram cloud.\nThis action must be confirmed via your Telegram account and cannot be undone.</p>\n<i>\n</i>10.2.\nMessages\n<ul>\n<li>In secret chats, deleting a message always instructs the app on the other end to delete it too.</li>\n<li>In cloud chats, you can choose to delete a message for all participants within at least 48 hours after sending.\nOtherwise, deleting a message will delete it from your message history.\nThis means that a copy will stay on the server as part of your partner's message history.\nAs soon as your partner deletes it too, it's gone forever.</li>\n<li>As of version 5.5, any party can choose to delete any messages in one-on-one chats, both sent and received, for both sides.\nThere is no time limit.\nAny party can also opt to clear the entire chat history for both parties, in which case the apps will be instructed to remove all messages in that chat, however many of them are still retained by either of the participants.</li>\n<li>In supergroups and channels, deleting a message removes it for all participants.\nNote that deleted messages and original versions of edited messages from supergroups are stored for 48 hours after deletion in order to be shown in the admins log.</li>\n</ul>\n<i>\n</i>10.3.\nSelf-Destructing Messages\n<p>Messages in Secret Chats can be ordered to self-destruct.\nAs soon as such a message is read (2 checks appear), the countdown starts.\nWhen the timer expires, both devices participating in a secret chat are instructed to delete the message (photo, video, etc.).\nMedia with short timers (less than a minute) are shown with blurred previews.\nThe timer is triggered when they are viewed.</p>\n<i>\n</i>10.4.\nAccount Self-Destruction\n<p>By default, if you stop using Telegram and do not come online for at least 6 months, your account will be deleted along with all messages, media, contacts and every other piece of data you store in the Telegram cloud.\nYou can go to Settings to change the exact period after which your inactive account will self-destruct.</p>\n<i>\n</i>11.\nChanges to this Privacy Policy\n<p>We will review and may update this

Account deletion </li>\n<li> Changes to this policy </li>\n</ol>\n<p>This document describes what information we collect and what it\u2019s used for.\nIt applies to all interactions with riseup.net.\nYour use of riseup.net services will constitute your agreement to our Privacy Policy.\nPlease also review our Terms of Service.</p> Summary <p>You have a reasonable expectation of privacy regarding any communication or data transiting or stored on this information system.\nWe collect very little personal information, and none of the information we do collect is ever shared.</p> Information we collect and retain Registration information <p>When you create an account, we retain the date you registered (rounded to the nearest quarter year).\nAccount request information is removed after four months, and invite status is removed after one month.\nIf you choose to set a reset email address, we retain this record but in a format that is unreadable by us (it is stored in a hashed digest, similar to how passwords are stored).</p> Help tickets <p>The content of any help ticket you create or comment on while authenticated will be associated with your user account.\nYou can choose to fill out a help ticket anonymously by creating a ticket while not logged in.\nWe periodically delete old help tickets that are closed.</p> Session identifiers <p>While currently logged in, we keep a temporary session identifier on your computer that your software uses to prove your authentication state.\nThis is erased immediately after you log out or the session expires.\nWe do not use any third party cookies or tracking of any kind.</p> Email transit logs <p>In order to detect when our servers are under attack from a \u201cspam bomb\u201d or when a spammer is using our system, we keep a log of the \u201cfrom\u201d or \u201cto\u201d information for every message relayed.\nThese logs are purged on a daily basis.</p> Quarter of last log in <p>We keep a record of the quarter and year of your last successful authentication (in order to be able to disable and delete dormant accounts).\nWe do not record the time or day of the last log in.\nFor example, this information looks like \u201cQ3 2018\u201d.</p> Information we choose to not retain IP addresses <p>No IP addresses of any user for any service are retained.</p> Browser fingerprint <p>Your web browser communicates uniquely identifying information to all web servers it visits by allowing the site to know details about your operating system, browser information, plugins installed, fonts installed, screen resolution, and much more.\nWe do not retain any of this information.</p> Message metadata <p>Even when using end-to-end OpenPGP encryption for email messages, the email \u201csubject\u201d and routing information regarding the message \u201cfrom\u201d and \u201cto\u201d are seen by our servers in the clear when the email initially arrives.\nThis is due to inherent limitations in the email protocol and in OpenPGP.</p> How we store and share collected information Encryption <p>All of your data is stored in an encrypted format, and only Riseup has the keys to decrypt the data.\nAdditionally, as of March 2017, the storage for all new accounts is personally encrypted.\nRiseup is unable to read any of the stored content for these accounts.\nAny user with an account created prior to March 2017 may opt-in to personally encrypted storage.</p> We do not share user information <p>We retain only the bare minimum of information about each user that is required to make the service work.\nWe do not sell or share any of it.</p> Academic research <p>Anonymous, aggregated information that cannot be linked back to an individual user may be made available to experienced researchers for the sole purpose of developing better systems for anonymous and secure communication.\nFor example, we may aggregate information on how many messages a typical user sends and receives, and with what frequency.</p>\n<p>We will not read, search, or process any of your incoming or outgoing mail other than to protect you from viruses and spam or when directed to do so by you when troubleshooting.</p> Account deletion <p>You may choose to delete your riseup.net account at any time.\nDoing so will destroy all the data we retain that is associated with your account.\nThe usernames associated with deleted accounts remain unavailable for others to use for one year.</p> Changes to this policy <p>We reserve the right to change this policy.\nIf we make major changes, we will notify our users in a clear and prominent manner (like our Newsletters).\nMinor changes may only be highlighted in the footer of our website.</p> This site is run by Riseup, your friendly

This usually happens when they want logs, we tell them that we don\u2019t have any and then they come and take the machine because they don\u2019t believe us and want to see for themselves.\nHowever, all of our servers use full disk encryption, which means they cannot see or do anything with the data on the disks without the keys.\nNevertheless, we do not keep IP identifying logs, and store as little data as possible on our users.\nBut this is not just Riseup\u2019s responsibility, each user is responsible for limiting the amount of data that Riseup stores for them!</p> How can I limit the amount of data that Riseup stores for me? <p>There are several ways</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Account info:</strong> When you applied for an account you provided a little information.\nAfter you are approved we don\u2019t need this information anymore and you can clean it up.\nLogin to user.riseup.net and review the information that you have provided there and consider what information you have given us that identifies you.\nFor example, if Obama had a secret email address with Riseup and applied for the address using president@whitehouse.gov as his alternate email address, it would be a good idea for him to remove president@whitehouse.gov from his alternate email if he wanted to be able to engage in Constitutionally-protected, anonymous, speech.</p>\n<p>But please note: If you do remove your alternate email, and you later lose/forget your password, it will <em>not be possible</em> for us to reset your password.\nYou will be permanently locked out of your account and will not be able to access your emails.\nYou have been warned!</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Email:</strong> If you are not already, consider using an email client that lets you download email via the POP protocol and deletes it from the server.\nThere is no getting around the mail arriving on Riseup\u2019s server, but if you download it and it\u2019s deleted from the server then Riseup doesn\u2019t have it anymore.\nBut note this does have a downside, using webmail or the IMAP protocol does allow you to check email from more than one computer.\nIf you need that ability, one approach might be to move older email offline to a single computer and just check newer things from multiple locations.\nHere are some directions for downloading your email.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Lists:</strong> one of the nice features of having a mailing list is having a message archive.\nBut if the idea of someone you don\u2019t want getting access to that archive scares you, then it might be better to do without an archive or periodically move the archive to a more secure location.\nBut don\u2019t forget that any subscriber to your list gets a copy of every message, so even if you have the archives removed, there is nothing that prevents subscribers from leaking those messages! More info at: Downloading List Archives.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Ask yourself:</strong> where are the important emails, documents, and manifestos of your group stored? Do you have a good place for them for people to find when you are gone and people want to write the history about how you changed the world? If they are only stored in Riseup, that isn\u2019t good.\nDownload them and put them somewhere safer! We are birds, so we like eggs, but we don\u2019t like people putting all their eggs in our basket.</p> Will Riseup services last forever? <p>While we are committed to doing everything in our power to protect the data of social movements and activists, short of extended incarceration, we would rather pull the plug than submit to repressive surveillance by any government.\nWe would be really sad to see Riseup go, but if we are forced to, we would rather it go away than to betray your trust and compromise the activist community.\nWith this in mind, you should be sure you are prepared in case something does happen, such as downloading and archive your email on your own computer!</p> What about child porn, drugs, corruption, etc.\nWould you fight law enforcement requests for users doing these things? <p>Those things violate Riseup\u2019s Terms of Service and, unlike some more \u201cAmerican Libertarian\u201d service providers, we do not exist to provide privacy for doing anything you want.\nWe would close the accounts of people doing those things and the collective may even decide to cooperate with law enforcement rather than set all the servers on fire and destroy the organization, and your email.</p> This site is run by Riseup, your friendly \u24b6utonomous tech collective since 1999 <ul>\n<li> Donate! </li>\n<li> About Us </li>\n<li> Privacy Policy </li>\n</ul>

Us</strong>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>&nbsp;</p> Overview <p>This privacy statement explains how and why PayPal collects, stores, uses, and shares personal data when you visit our websites or use our services.\nReading it will help you understand your privacy rights and choices.</p>\n<p>\u201cPersonal data\u201d in this statement means information about you, including your identity, finances, and online behavior.</p>\n<p>\u201cPayPal\u201d in this statement means PayPal, Inc.\nThis privacy statement only applies to the PayPal and Xoom services offered by PayPal.\nTo learn about our privacy practices for our other products or services, like Venmo or Braintree, visit the website and review the privacy statement for that product or service.</p> Your privacy rights and choices <p>When it comes to how your personal data is collected, stored, used, and shared, you have rights and choices.</p>\n<strong>Understanding your rights</strong>\n<p>You have the right to request a copy of the personal data we\u2019ve collected about you in the past 12 months.\nYou also have the right to ask us to delete your personal data we have collected about you.\nIf you want to see or delete your personal data, contact us.\nWe will not deny you services, charge you different prices, or provide you with a different level of service solely for exercising your privacy rights.</p>\n<p>If you request to see or delete your personal data, we\u2019ll first need to verify who you are before we can respond to your request.\nIf we can\u2019t verify your identity, we will not be able to fulfill your request.</p>\n<p>If you want to delete your personal data, you have choices:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Log in to your account and delete information you previously added.\nFor example, you can delete your profile picture and non-primary addresses in your settings</li>\n<li>Call us and request that we delete specific information</li>\n<li>Close your account</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If you close your account or request that we delete personal data, we still need to keep some personal data so we can:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Complete a transaction, provide goods or services you requested, or comply with our promises to you in the User Agreement or other contract you have with us</li>\n<li>Detect and prevent malicious, fraudulent, or illegal activity</li>\n<li>Protect your (or another person\u2019s) legal rights, including the right to free speech</li>\n<li>Manage our internal business processes that are reasonably related to your expectations when using our services</li>\n<li>Comply with laws</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Depending on where you live and what type of account you use, you may have different rights and choices for managing your personal data.\nFor example, certain State privacy laws do not apply to personal data collected, processed, or disclosed by a financial institution according to federal laws, such as the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act.\nConsumers may read our <u>Consumer Privacy Notice</u> for more information about their rights under US federal law.</p>\n<strong>Understanding your choices</strong>\n<p>You can control how personal data is collected or shared, as well as how we communicate with you.\nHere are some of the ways you can customize your choices.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Choose how we collect personal data</strong>\n</p>\n<p>You may choose to limit the personal data you provide when our apps or services request it.\nTo help make choices that are right for you, it\u2019s important to understand that personal data helps us provide a richer, more personalized experience for you.\nAlso, some personal data is required for our services to function at all.</p>\n<p>For example, sharing your contacts helps make it easier for you to find the people you want to send money to.\nIf you choose not to share your contacts with us, you can still use our mobile apps, but some actions may not be as fast or easy as it would be if shared your contacts.\nAnother example is creating an account with us.\nIf you choose not to provide information that is required for an account to function, like your name and email address, we will not be able to create an account for you.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Choose how connected accounts collect and use personal data</strong>\n</p>\n<p>If you connect your account to a third-party service, you may be able to manage how your personal data is collected, used, and shared by them.\nRead the third parties\u2019 privacy policies to see the choices they offer you.</p>\n<p>You can control which third-party services you connect to your account and what personal data they can collect about you.\nFor example, to manage the permissions, go to the Security settings in your PayPal account.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Choose how we communicate with you</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Your choices about how we communicate with you differ depending on the purpose of the message and how it is delivered.\nSome messages are considered optional and some are necessary for you to manage your accounts with us.\nWe use email, text messages, push notifications on your mobile device, and even paper mail depending on the situation and your preferences.</p>\n<p>You can click the unsubscribe link in a marketing email, opt out of a text message by replying \u201cSTOP,\u201d or turn off notifications on your device.\nYou can also change your account\u2019s notification settings or the notification preferences on your device.</p>\n<p>You won\u2019t be able to opt out of messages that are considered necessary for you to manage your account, such as receipts and emails that alert you to changes in your account\u2019s status that require your attention.\nYou may be able to decide how we send those messages, such as by email, text message, or a notification on your mobile device.</p> The personal data we collect <p>We may collect your personal data when you register for or use our services, such as when you create an account, make a payment, or make a purchase on a merchant\u2019s website.</p>\n<p>If you use our services without creating or logging into an account, we\u2019ll still collect personal data, which may include your payment information, device information, and location.\nWhen you use our services without creating or logging into an account, we will use this information to process transactions, prevent fraud and comply with the law.\nWe may connect this information with your account, if you have one or if you create an account at a later date.</p>\n<p>Here are the kinds of personal data that we may collect when you create an account or use our services:</p>\n<p>1.\nInformation that identifies you, for example:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>First and last name</li>\n<li>Address</li>\n<li>Phone

information</li>\n</ul>\n<p>3.\nPersonal characteristics, for example:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Age</li>\n<li>National origin</li>\n<li>Disability</li>\n<li>Citizenship</li>\n<li>Military status</li>\n</ul>\n<p>4.\nCommercial information, for example:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Online shopping cart information</li>\n<li>Purchase history</li>\n</ul>\n<p>5.\nInternet or network activity, for example:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Interactions with our services or sites</li>\n<li>Shopping history</li>\n</ul>\n<p>6.\nGeolocation data, for example:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Global Positioning System (GPS) information when you give us permission through your device settings</li>\n<li>IP-based geolocation</li>\n</ul>\n<p>7.\nAudio, electronic, visual, biometric, or similar information, for

deliver services to you, and market our services</li>\n</ul>\n<p>We do not knowingly collect personal information from people who are not allowed to use our sites and services, such as children under the age of 13.\n<u>Contact us</u> if you believe that we\u2019ve mistakenly collected personal data from someone not allowed to use our services.\nWe\u2019ll delete it immediately, unless we\u2019re legally required to keep it.</p>\n<strong>How we use tracking technologies like cookies</strong>\n<p>We or our authorized service providers may use cookies and similar tracking technologies to collect personal data whenever you use our services, visit our sites, or visit websites that offer our services.\nThe information collected with these technologies helps us personalize your experience, measure the effect of our ads, prevent fraud and enhance the security of our sites and service.</p>\n<p>You can disable or decline some cookies for our sites and services.\nBut, since some parts of our service rely on cookies to work, those services could become difficult or impossible to use.</p>\n<p>Some web browsers have an optional setting called \u201cDo Not Track\u201d (DNT) that lets you opt-out of being tracked by advertisers and some third parties.\nBecause many of our services won\u2019t function without tracking data, we do not respond to DNT settings.</p>\n<p>If you want to know more about how we use cookies, read our <u>Cookie Statement</u>.\nTo learn how to opt-out of this kind of tracking technology, visit <u>About Ads</u>.</p> Why we collect personal data <p>We collect

Agreement PAYPAL USER AGREEMENT About Your Account <p>This user agreement will be effective for all users as of September 14, 2020.\n</p> Welcome to PayPal!<p>These are the terms and conditions of the contract between you and PayPal (Europe) S.a r.l.\net Cie, S.C.A.\n(\u201cPayPal\u201d) governing your use of your PayPal account and the PayPal services, which we call our user agreement.\nIt applies only to PayPal accounts of residents of Netherlands.\nIf you are an individual, you must be at least 18 years old and have full legal capacity to enter into a contract to open a PayPal account and use the PayPal services.\nIf you are a business, the business must be registered in Netherlands.</p>\n<p>To use the PayPal services you need to open a PayPal account.\nBy opening and using a PayPal account, you agree to comply with all of the terms and conditions in this user agreement.\nYou also agree to comply with the following additional documents and each of the other documents on the Legal Agreements page that apply to you:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Fees page</li>\n<li>Privacy Statement</li>\n<li>Acceptable Use Policy</li>\n<li>All future changes notified in the Policy Update already published on the \u201cLegal Agreements\u201d page.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Please read carefully all of the terms and conditions of this user agreement and each of the other documents that apply to you.</p>\n<p>We may revise this user agreement and any of the documents listed above from time to time.\nThe revised version will be effective at the time we post it, unless otherwise noted.\nIf our changes reduce your rights or increase your responsibilities we will post a notice on the Policy Updates page of our website and provide notice to you of at least two months.\nBy continuing to use our services after any changes to this user agreement take effect, you agree to be bound by those changes.\nIf you do not agree with any changes, you may close your account before the changes take effect.</p> Information about us and our service<p>PayPal\u2019s main business is the issuance of electronic money and the provision of payment services using that electronic money.</p>\n<p>For more information about us and our service, you can read our Key Payment and Service Information.</p>\n<p>This user agreement, together with other legal terms and legally required disclosures relating to your use of our service will be made available to you at all times on the PayPal website (typically located on the \u201cLegal Agreements\u201d page).\nWe may also send this information to you.</p>\n<p>You may request a copy of any legally required disclosures (including this user agreement and the Key Payment and Service Information) from us and we will provide this to you in a form which allows you to store and reproduce the information (for example, by e-mail).\n</p> Opening an account <p>We offer two types of accounts: personal accounts and business accounts.</p>Personal accounts<p>With a personal account you can send and request money from friends and family and pay online for purchases.</p>\n<p>Holders of certain existing personal accounts may be required to upgrade their accounts (which may include providing further information to PayPal) in order to be able to use all of the current functionality available in a personal account.\n</p>\n<p>To use your PayPal account primarily to sell things, you must open a business account or convert your personal account to a business account.</p>Business accounts <p>Business accounts are for people and organisations (whether incorporated or not) that primarily use PayPal to receive online payments for sales or donations.</p>\n<p>Business accounts may be subject to fees that differ from the fees applicable to personal accounts.\nSee our Fees for further details.</p>\n<strong>\n<p>By opening a business account or converting a personal account to a business account, you certify to us that you are using it primarily for a business or commercial purpose.\n</p>\n</strong> Commercial Entity Status <p>If the activity through your business account reaches certain thresholds or involves certain business segments or activities, you are required by the card networks to agree to Commercial Entity Agreements directly with our processing partners to allow you to continue accepting card-funded payments.\nIn this case, these Commercial Entity Agreements will apply to any payment processed by PayPal on your behalf in addition to this user agreement.\n</p> Safe use of your PayPal account <p>You should take reasonable steps to stop your PayPal account being misused.\nYou must maintain adequate security and control of any and all devices, items, IDs, passwords and personal identification numbers / codes that you use to access your PayPal account and the PayPal services.\nPlease see our Key Payment and Service Information for guidelines.\n</p>\n<p>You must comply with all reasonable instructions we may issue regarding how you can keep your Payment Instrument safe.</p>\n<p>We may require you to authenticate any instruction relating to your account (i.e.\ngive us the information that we need to be sure that it\u2019s you giving us the instruction, such as submitting your correct log-in information \u2013 this could include your e-mail address and password) and otherwise successfully log into your PayPal account to provide to us your instruction.</p>\n<p>You must keep your postal address, email address and other contact information current in your PayPal account profile.</p>\n<p>You may expressly grant, remove and manage permissions for some third parties to take certain actions on your behalf.\nIn some cases you can do this when logged into your account \u2013 in other cases you can do this directly with the third party.\nYou acknowledge that if you grant permission for a third party to take actions on your behalf, we may disclose certain information about your Account to this third party.</p>\n<p>You may permit third party service providers licensed by applicable law to: </p>\n<ul>\n<li>provide account information services to access information about your account on your behalf;</li>\n<li>confirm whether an amount necessary for the execution of a card-based payment transaction is available on your account.\nor</li>\n<li>provide payment initiation services to initiate payments from your account on your behalf.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Granting permission to any third party to access your account in any way does not relieve you of any of your responsibilities under this user agreement.\nYou are liable to us for the actions that you authorise the third parties to carry out.\nYou will not hold us responsible for, and you will indemnify us from, any liability arising from the actions or inactions of such third parties in connection with the permissions you granted, subject to your mandatory legal rights.</p> Closing Your PayPal Account <p>\n<strong>You can close your account at any time.</strong> See the PayPal Help Centre for how to do this.</p>\n<p>We may close your account at our convenience by providing you with two months\u2019 prior notice.\nWe may also close your account at any time if:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>you are in breach of this user agreement and/or we are otherwise entitled to close your account under this user agreement;</li>\n<li>you do not access your account for three years.\nor</li>\n<li>we suspect that your account has been accessed without your authorisation.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Where we decide to close your account we will provide you with notice of account closure and where practicable, the reasons for closing your account, together with the ability to withdraw any undisputed funds that we are holding.</p>\n<p>When your account is closed:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>this user agreement terminates immediately, except that this user agreement survives termination to the extent and for so long as we require to deal with the closure of your account and to comply with applicable laws and regulations;</li>\n<li>we may cancel any pending transactions and you will forfeit any balances associated with special funding arrangements;</li>\n<li>we may suspend, limit or terminate your access to or use of our services, websites, software, systems (including any networks and servers used to provide any of the services) operated by us or on our behalf or some or all of the services;</li>\n<li>you will remain liable for all outstanding obligations under this user agreement related to your account prior to closure;</li>\n<li>we may keep your account information in our database for the purpose of fulfilling our legal obligations.\nand</li>\n<li>we may retain your electronic money after closure to the extent and for the time we reasonably require to protect us and/or any third party against the risk of reversals, fees, fines, penalties and other liabilities of whatever nature.\nAfter this time you will be able to withdraw any undisputed funds that we are holding.\nPlease Contact Us if you have any questions about funds held in your account on closure.<br>\n<strong>If you are the legal representative of an incapacitated or deceased account holder, please Contact Us for assistance.</strong>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In the event that we decide to discontinue any of our services or any portion or feature of our services for any reason, we will give you at least two months prior notice before discontinuing the service or feature, unless we determine in good faith that: </p>\n<ul>\n<li>the service or feature must be discontinued sooner as required by law or a third-party relationship.\nor </li>\n<li>doing so could create a security risk or substantial economic or material technical burden.</li>\n</ul> Linking and Unlinking a Funding Source <p>All money in your account is legally termed \u201celectronic money\u201d, which is recognised throughout the European Economic Area as a form of money suitable for use online.\n</p>\n<p>You can use a funding source as a way to pay us to obtain electronic money in your account or to receive withdrawals from your account, as further outlined in this user agreement (see in particular Adding or Withdrawing Money and Funding your Payment.\n</p>\n<p>You can link or unlink a credit card, debit card, a prepaid card (where available) a bank account or PayPal Credit (where available) to your PayPal account as a funding source.\n</p>\n<p>We may limit the availability of your funding sources to manage our risk.</p>\n<p>Please keep your funding source information current (e.g.\ncredit card number and expiration date).\nIf this information changes, we may update it using information and third-party sources available to us without any action on your part.\nIf you do not want us to update your card information, you may contact your issuer to request this or remove your funding source from your PayPal account.\nIf we update your funding source, we will keep any preference setting attached to that funding source.\nYou may choose to confirm your card or bank account, so that we can verify that the card or bank account is valid and that you are its owner.\nWe may allow you to do this by following the Link and Confirm Card process (for cards) or the Bank Confirmation process (for bank accounts) or other processes which we may notify to you or which we may publish from time to time.</p>Your continuous permission for us to charge your funding sources <p>By linking a funding source to your PayPal account, you give us continuous permission to automatically charge that funding source (subject to this user agreement and the terms of any mandate (e.g.\nbank direct debit) used by the provider of that funding source to set up and maintain that authority) for the required value of the electronic money:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>to cover the payment amount (plus all transaction fees payable to us) when you use your account to send a payment to another user.\nand</li>\n<li>to top up your account when you use the Add Funds functionality account interface.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>We may charge the funding source again if the previous attempt failed.\nIf you cancel any continuous permission from your funding source, you will reimburse us for the value of any electronic money we\u2019ve already issued for which a charge from that funding source remains outstanding.\n</p>\n<p>You can stop the permission by unlinking the funding source from your PayPal account.</p>\n<p>SEPA is an initiative of the European Commission and European banking sector, aimed at making transactions more efficient within the European Union.\nWhenever you register a bank account with PayPal or use a new bank account for the first time as a Funding Source, you grant PayPal a SEPA Direct Debit mandate.\nIf you use a SEPA Direct Debit mandate for the continuous authority:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>you can access the mandate and the mandate reference number (MRN) in your PayPal account profile at any time and cancel or change the mandate for future transactions.</li>\n<li>PayPal will inform you of the amount of the SEPA Direct Debit payment and the time frame in which PayPal will collect the amount from the bank account together with the purchase confirmation.\nIf PayPal resubmits any SEPA Direct Debit payment request due to reversal of the original payment, there will be no (additional) information given on the amount and the time frame ahead of the resubmission.</li>\n<li>you can claim a refund from your bank at any time up to 8 weeks after the date on which the SEPA Direct Debit payment took place in accordance with your bank\u2019s terms and conditions.</li>\n</ul> Risk of reversals to your funding source and when eCheques may arise <p>When we receive a payment from your funding source we may store the resulting electronic money in your reserve account for as long as we have reason to believe that there is risk of reversal by the funding source provider.\nThis is because we do not have all the information necessary to place the funds from your payment at your disposal in your PayPal balance while there is such a risk of reversal.\n</p>\n<p>When you instruct us to make a payment from your account to another user funded by a payment from your bank account and we store the resulting electronic money in this way, we call this type of payment from your bank account an \u201ceCheque\u201d payment.\nSee Funding payments you send from your account below for how we use eCheques.</p> Holding and using a PayPal balance <p>You will not receive interest or any other earnings on the money in your account.\nThis is because the money in your account is electronic money and European law forbids paying interest on electronic money.\nAlso, electronic money is not a deposit or an investment under Luxembourg law, so the Luxembourg deposit guarantee or investor indemnity schemes administered by the <i>Conseil des Protection des Deposants et des Investisseurs</i> cannot protect you.</p>\n<p>We may store and move the money in your account in and between:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>the PayPal balance.\nand </li>\n<li>the reserve account, </li>\n</ul>\n<p>at any given time subject further to this user agreement.</p>PayPal balance <p>The operational part of your account contains your PayPal balance, which is the balance of money available for payments or withdrawals.\n</p>\n<p>When you use our payment service to pay another user, you instruct us to transfer the money from your PayPal balance to the recipient\u2019s account.\n</p>\n<p>You need to have enough PayPal balance in cleared funds to cover the amount of any payment you make and the transaction fees you owe us at the time of the payment.\nOther requirements also apply \u2013 see the section Making a Payment below.\nIf you have insufficient PayPal balance or have chosen a preferred funding source you are also requesting us to obtain funds on your behalf from your applicable funding source and issue electronic money to your PayPal balance for your payment to be made.</p>\n<p>When you withdraw your money you need to have enough PayPal balance to cover the value of any withdrawal at the time of the withdrawal.</p>\n<p>See Adding or Withdrawing Money to know how to get a PayPal balance and how to withdraw it.</p>\n<p>If your PayPal balance shows a negative amount, this is the net amount you owe to us at the given time.\n</p> Reserve account <p>Money marked in your account overview as \u201cpending\u201d, \u201cuncleared\u201d, \u201cheld\u201d or otherwise restricted or limited at any given time is held in the part of your account which acts as a reserve account.\nYou cannot access and use money stored in the reserve account.</p> Adding or Withdrawing Money Adding money <p>To get electronic money into your account you can, subject further to this user agreement:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>accept a payment in your account from someone else.\nWe may charge you fees for this.\nor</li>\n<li>obtain electronic money from us by paying us an equivalent amount.\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>You can obtain electronic money from us by:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>automatically using your applicable funding source(s) to cover the amount of the payments that you instruct us to send to other users (and the transaction fees payable by you to us)..\nor</li>\n<li>manually using the \u201cAdd Funds\u201d function available from your account interface to pay us or instructing us to charge your funding source for the electronic money.\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The execution of any payment to us from your funding source provider is your funding source provider\u2019s legal responsibility.\nWe have no control over how long the payment to us will take.</p>Withdrawing money <p>If you have a PayPal balance, you may withdraw any amount by transferring it to your nominated funding source linked to your PayPal account, as we may allow from time to time.\nThis could include your bank account or debit or credit card, depending on the country in which your PayPal account is registered.</p>\n<p>When you instruct us to withdraw any amount of your PayPal balance, subject further to this user agreement we will:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>convert the electronic money to money that we can transfer to your nominated funding source.\nand </li>\n<li>instruct our own bank to transfer that money to your nominated funding source.\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>We aim to send the withdrawal payment instruction to our bank by the end of the next Business Day (\u201cBusiness Day\u201d means a day on which banks in Luxembourg are open to the general public).\nif there are no other delays subject to this user agreement.\nOnce our bank receives our payment instruction, we have no control over how long the payment to you will take to complete.\nAt this point, our bank, your funding source provider and the payment systems that they rely on take over responsibility for getting the money to your nominated funding source and this can affect the time it takes for you to receive your money.\nWe may allow you to withdraw the money by transferring the money to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>an eligible bank account (where we make this available) through: <ul>\n<li>a standard transfer to your bank account linked to your account (this withdrawal/redemption functionality is sometimes known as \u201ctransfer to bank\u201d).\nor</li>\n<li>an Instant Transfer to your bank account linked to your account.\n<br>\n<br> We may allow the above transfers to be made through the debit card attached to that bank account.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>your branded MasterCard or Visa card (where we make this available).</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Fees apply to withdrawals.\nWe will also disclose to you the fees in advance each time you initiate such a withdrawal.</p>\n<p>The funding source (for example, bank account or card) into which you request the withdrawal must be denominated in the original opening currency of your account or another currency that PayPal supports for withdrawals in your country of residence.</p>\n<p>You may only withdraw PayPal balance in the opening currency of your account, unless we agree otherwise.\nIn order to withdraw PayPal balance held in another currency you will have to convert the currency to the opening currency of your account, or it will be converted for you at the time of your withdrawal.\nOur transaction exchange rate will be used.</p>\n<p>This means that if you withdraw:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>a PayPal balance held in a currency other than the original opening currency of your account, you will be charged a fee for the conversion into your original opening currency.\nand</li>\n<li>to a funding source (for example, bank account or card) denominated in a currency other than the original opening currency of your account, you will be charged a fee for the conversion into the currency in which the funding source is denominated.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>To protect you, our other users and us from loss and to allow us to comply with our anti-money laundering and other legal obligations, we may delay a withdrawal, in certain situations, including if we need to confirm that you have authorised the withdrawal or if payments to your PayPal account have been subject to a reversal (for example, as a result of a chargeback, bank reversal or dispute by a buyer).\nIf we place a limitation on your PayPal account, a payment is subject to a hold, or your account or an associated account has a negative balance in any currency while a withdrawal from your PayPal account is pending, you will have to reinitiate the withdrawal once the limitation or hold has been lifted, or negative balance is fully paid off.</p>\n<p>We may set limits on your withdrawals, and you can view any withdrawal limit by logging into your PayPal account.\nYou must follow the steps that we will notify to you or publish from time to time (which we may set out in your account overview) to lift your withdrawal limit.</p> Managing Your Money in Multiple Currencies <p>When you open your account, it is configured for use with the opening currency of your account.\n</p>\n<p>The opening currency of your account is Euro (EUR).\n</p>\n<p>We may configure your account further so that you can use it to store money and send and receive payments in currencies other than the opening currency of your account.\nIf you hold a PayPal balance, we may allow you to convert it to balance in another currency.\n</p>\n<p> If your PayPal balance is not enough to cover the amount of a payment you instruct us to make in a particular currency, we may perform a currency conversion from any PayPal balance in another currency to cover the shortfall.\nThere may be some restrictions on where you can send payments in certain currencies.\n</p>\n<p> We may allow you to choose the way in which your account treats and/or converts payments received in currencies other than the opening currency of your account.\nTo receive money in a currency other than the opening currency of your account, it may be necessary to create a balance in that currency or convert the money into another currency that we allow you to hold.\n</p>\n<p> Payments in certain currencies can only be received by automatic conversion of the money into another currency that we allow you to hold.\n</p>\n<p> If you receive a payment from anyone who doesn\u2019t have a PayPal account and that payment is in a currency which your account is not currently configured to use, we may automatically convert the amount received into a currency that your account is configured to use at the time the payment is made.\n</p>\n<p> Please see the Withdrawing Money section above to see how withdrawals in different currencies can be made.\n</p>\n<p> If one of the currency balances in your account shows that you owe us an amount of funds for any reason, we may set off the amount you owe us by using funds you maintain in a different currency balance or by deducting amounts you owe us from money you receive into your account, or money you attempt to withdraw or send from your account, or in a different account, and by deducting funds from any withdrawals you attempt to make.\nIf, for a period of 21 Days, you have a PayPal balance that reflects an amount owing to us that is not in Euros, we may convert the amount you owe us to Euros.\n</p>\n<p> We may, at our discretion, impose limits on the amount of money you can convert or the number of conversions you can perform.\nYou are responsible for all risks associated with maintaining multiple currencies in a PayPal account.\nYou may not manage or convert currencies for speculative trading purposes, conversion arbitrage, conversion options, or any other activity that we determine is primarily for the purpose of gaining or making money based on currency conversion rates.\nWe may hold, cancel, or reverse any transaction we determine to violate this policy.\n</p>How we convert currency <p>If PayPal converts currency, it will be completed at the transaction exchange rate we set for the relevant currency exchange.\n</p>\n<p> The transaction exchange rate is adjusted regularly and includes a currency conversion fee applied and retained by us on a base exchange rate to form the rate applicable to your conversion.\nThe base exchange rate is based on rates within the wholesale currency markets on the conversion day or the prior Business Day.\nor, if required by law or regulation, set at the relevant government reference rate(s).\n</p>\n<p> We may make a transaction exchange rate (including our currency conversion fee) available for your review during your transaction.\nIf you complete the transaction, that transaction exchange rate may apply to the payment for the transaction whenever it is processed.\nor that rate may be valid only if the payment for that transaction is processed within a limited time, as stated during the transaction.\nAfter that limited time, we may use the transaction exchange rate in effect at the time the transaction is processed, or not perform the currency conversion.\n</p>\n<p> If you have authorised a payment under a billing agreement, and we perform currency conversion for that payment, we will use the transaction exchange rate in effect at the time the payment transaction is processed.\nThe transaction exchange rate for each payment under a billing agreement may vary.\n</p>\n<p> We may provide you access to a \u201cCurrency Converter\u201d tool to see what transaction exchange rate (including our currency conversion fee) may apply for certain currency conversions.\nAny rates shown using the Currency Converter tool only apply at the time you use the tool and are subject to change.</p> Currency conversion choices <p>When your payment is funded by a debit or credit card and PayPal determines currency conversion is necessary, you consent to and authorise us to convert the currency in place of your debit or credit card issuer.\n</p>\n<p> You may have the right to have your card issuer convert the currency of the card payment into the currency in which you send the payment from your PayPal account, if applicable for that card issuer and network.\nThis selection may be presented to you in various forms, including a choice of which currency is used for the transaction, whether we or your card issuer performs the conversion, or which conversion rate is used for the transaction, among others.\nIf your card issuer converts the currency, your card issuer will determine the currency conversion rate and what fees they may charge.\n</p>\n<p> PayPal will always perform the conversion for transactions where you use existing balance or your linked bank account is the funding source.\n</p>\n<p> If PayPal determines currency conversion is necessary for a transaction that also requires a backup funding source to be chosen, you may not be able to separately choose whether PayPal or your card issuer performs the currency conversion on the payment from your backup funding source.\n</p>\n<p> Where a currency conversion is offered at the point of sale by the merchant, not by PayPal, and you choose to authorise the payment transaction on the basis of the merchant's exchange rate and charges, PayPal has no liability to you for that currency conversion.\n</p> Account Statements and Requesting Account Records <p>Unless your Account is restricted you may view and download your PayPal account statement by logging into your PayPal account.\nYou agree to review your transactions through your PayPal account history instead of receiving periodic statements by email.\n</p>\n<p>Key information relating to your payments will be provided to you via e-mail and your transaction history will also be updated and made available to you at any time by logging into your account.\nYou can also access a downloadable report from your PayPal account.\nThis will show all fees incurred and any other amounts charged to your PayPal account in the relevant period.\nThe report will only be updated and made available if there has been any activity on your PayPal account or any fees have been incurred in the relevant period.\nThe way in which we provide the transaction information will allow you to store and reproduce the information unchanged, for example by printing a copy.\n</p>\n<p> We reserve the right to charge a fee for providing you with additional information or for providing the transaction history and other information about fees in a different way but we won\u2019t charge you for records requested in connection with your good-faith assertion of an error in your PayPal account.</p> Fees <p> We charge fees for our services as set out on the fees page.\n</p>\n<p> Quoted fees are inclusive of all applicable taxes.\nhowever, other taxes or costs may exist that are not paid through or imposed by us.\n</p>\n<p> You are liable for telephone charges and any charges made by your internet service provider or similar or associated charges as a result of the use by you of our services.\n</p>\n<p> We may deduct our fees from your PayPal balance.\nWe may deduct our transaction-related fees from the amounts we transfer before those funds are credited to your PayPal balance.\n</p>\n<p> We will provide you with the details of the amounts you receive and our fees charged either by e-mail or in your transaction history (which you can access by logging into your account).\n</p>\n<p> If your payment requires you to pay a fee to us, we may disclose that fee to you when you provide your payment instruction to us.\n</p>\n<p> You cannot set off or deduct any amounts from our fees.\n</p>\n<p> We may make a charge for any additional services we provide outside this user agreement.\nWe will tell you of those charges when you ask for the service.\n</p>\n<p>If you are a merchant and you wish to apply for (and retain) our volume-based tiered merchant rate, the terms of the merchant rate in the Receiving Payments section below apply.</p> PAYPAL USER AGREEMENT\nMaking A Payment General provisions for making a payment Your payment instruction <p>We may allow you to provide your payment instruction to us in any way which we may notify to you from time to time.\nThe way in which you provide your payment instruction can depend on the type of payment you are making \u2013 for example:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>If you are paying for a purchase or making a donation, many sellers and/or fund collectors allow you to provide your payment instruction to us in a dedicated PayPal checkout or other PayPal payment collection integration on their site.</li>\n<li>You can use the \u201cSend Money\u201d feature when you log into your PayPal account to send a payment to someone.\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p> We may require you to authenticate your instruction (i.e.\ngive us the information that we need to be sure that it\u2019s you giving us the instruction, such as submitting your correct log-in information \u2013 this could include your e-mail address and password) and otherwise successfully log into your PayPal account to provide to us your payment instruction.\n</p> Cancelling your payment instruction <p> Once you provide you payment instruction to us, you may not cancel it, except if it is a payment instruction under a billing agreement (see below for more details).\n</p> How long will my payment take? <p>Your payment to another user will leave your account [within the Business Day] after we receive your complete payment instruction.</p>\n<p>The payment will leave your account within two Business Days if we receive your complete payment instruction:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>on a day which is not a Business Day.\nor</li>\n<li>after the following local cut off times on a Business Day for accounts registered in the following countries: 4pm in Netherlands.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>We may allow you to ask us to make your payment on a specific later date, in which case your payment will leave your account on that later date.</p>\n<p>Other provisions in this user agreement may cause the above timeframes to be extended.</p>When we may refuse to make your payment <p>We may treat your payment instruction as not complete and we may refuse to make your payment if:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>you do not have enough money in your PayPal balance.\n</li>\n<li>we have reason to believe that your linked funding sources do not have sufficient funds to cover the money required to make your payment;</li>\n<li>you do not provide us with all mandatory information requested in the relevant payment or checkout flows which we use to obtain your payment instructions (for instance, sufficient details of the recipient as we may request and authentication of your payment instruction);</li>\n<li>the payment exceeds the sending limit we tell you about when you try to make the payment.\nor</li>\n<li>we have reason to believe that a restricted activity has happened in relation to your account or you are otherwise in breach of this user agreement.\n</li>\n</ul> When your payment is not accepted by the recipient <p> If we allow you to send a payment to someone who does not have a PayPal account, the recipient can claim the money by opening a PayPal account.\n</p>\n<p> If the recipient already has a PayPal account, they can refuse to accept the money.\n</p>\n<p> If the recipient refuses to accept the money or doesn\u2019t open a PayPal account and claim the money within 30 days after the date it is sent, the money (including any fees you were charged) will be refunded to your PayPal account.\nSee Refunds to your account for what can happen when your PayPal account receives a refund.\n</p> Sending limits <p> We may, at our discretion, impose limits on the amount and value of payments you can make, including money you send for purchases.\nYou can view any sending limit by logging into your PayPal account.\nTo lift your sending limit, you must follow the steps that we will notify to you or publish from time to time (which we may set out in your account overview).</p> Setting up automatic charges from your account Seller delayed payments <p> When you pay certain sellers or pay for certain purchases (for instance, purchases which have to be shipped to you or may be updated and finalised by the seller), you are providing: </p>\n<ul>\n<li>an authorisation to the seller to collect your payment at a later time.\nand</li>\n<li>an instruction to us to automatically pay that seller when the seller requests payment.</li>\n</ul>\n<p> Your authorisation will typically remain valid for up to 30 days, but may remain valid for longer.\nIf you have balance, we may hold the payment amount as pending until the seller collects your payment.\nIf your payment requires a currency conversion by us, the transaction exchange rate will be determined and applied (as described in the Currency Conversion section) at the time the payment is processed.\n</p>\n<p> Your authorisation allows the seller to update the payment amount before the seller collects the payment (to account for any changes to the purchase that you may agree with the seller, such as additional taxes, shipping or postage charges or discounts).\nWe are not required to verify any changes at any time (including at the time the payment is transferred).\nWe may transfer any amount on the basis of your authorisation and upon receiving instructions from the seller of the final payment amount.\n</p> Billing agreement payments <p> You can use a billing agreement to manage payments to the same recipient(s) on an ongoing automatic basis.\nWhen you enter into a billing agreement:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>you authorise the named recipient(s) to collect payments from your account as the recipient determines (this could be for payments of amounts you owe the recipient for a purchase of goods or services under a separate contract that you have with the recipient).\nand</li>\n<li>you instruct PayPal to pay the named recipient(s) (or other recipient(s) that the named recipient(s) direct(s)) when the named recipient(s) request(s) PayPal to make your payment.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>This makes the recipient a \u201ctrusted beneficiary\u201d (the legal term for someone you tell us is a trusted recipient) of all your payments made under that billing agreement, so we will not normally ask you to authenticate (e.g.\nlog in) or approve these payments when they are made.\n</p>\n<p> Payments made under the billing agreement may be in variable amounts and may be made on various dates.\nWe are only a payment service provider so we can\u2019t (and please don\u2019t expect us to) know what you have or haven\u2019t agreed with the recipient or to know why the recipient decided to collect your payment.\nWe are not obliged to verify or confirm the amount the recipient presents to us for the purpose of processing payments made under the billing agreement.\n</p>\n<p> We use several names for payments that can be managed by a billing agreement \u2013 these include \u201cautomatic payments,\u201d \"subscription payments\" \"recurring payments\u201d \u201creference transactions\u201d \"preauthorised transfers\" or \"preapproved payment.\" </p>\n<p> You can cancel your billing agreement at any time with immediate effect in your account interface or by contacting us.\nWhere a payment under that billing agreement is scheduled to be made before the end of the next Business Day after you tell us to cancel it, we may cancel your billing agreement after that payment has been made.\nIf you cancel a billing agreement, you may still owe the recipient money for goods or services that you have received but have not paid for.\n</p>\n<p> If we determine currency conversion is necessary for a billing agreement payment, and we perform the conversion, we will use the transaction exchange rate (including our currency conversion fee) in effect at the time the payment is processed.\nThe transaction exchange rate for each payment transaction may vary.\n</p> Refunds to your account How refunds can happen <p> We may allow the recipient of your payment to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>refuse to accept it.\nor</li>\n<li>decide to accept it and then use our service to send you a refund of all or any part of the amount of the payment later.\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p> We will return the amount of any refused payment or refunded payment to your Balance.\nWe will return the amount of an unclaimed payment to your balance within 30 days after the date you initiated the payment.\nIf any amount of any payment is returned to you in any of the ways outlined above, we may convert the returned amount for you into either: </p>\n<ul>\n<li>the currency of the balance you used for the original payment (before any conversion into the currency received by the recipient happened);</li>\n<li>the opening currency of your account.\nor</li>\n<li>US dollars (opening a balance in that currency for you, if you don\u2019t have one already).</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If the original payment you sent involved a currency conversion we will convert the returned amount from the currency received by the recipient as follows:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>if the amount is returned within 1 day of the date of the original payment we will use the transaction exchange rate applicable on the date of the original payment, so that you receive the original amount (including the currency conversion fee you paid) in the original currency you converted for the original payment.\nand</li>\n<li>if the amount is returned after 1 day of the date of the original payment we will use the transaction exchange rate applicable at the time of the conversion of the returned amount.\nYou agree to bear the currency conversion fee for amounts returned to you as refunds or refused payments.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Unless otherwise outlined above in this section, you agree to bear the currency conversion fee for amounts returned to you as refunds or refused payments when you convert any amount returned to you in the ways outlined above.\nThe transaction exchange rate may be applied immediately and without notice to you.\n</p>\n<p> We may also automatically withdraw the returned amount from your Balance and transfer the funds back to the funding source you used for the original payment.\nWithdrawals can also involve a currency conversion \u2013 see the section on Withdrawing money above.\n</p>Risks when receiving refunds <p> The returned amount could be lower in value than your original payment amount.\nThis can happen as a result of:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>the recipient sending you a refund lower in value than your original payment amount.\nAs we are only a payment service provider, we cannot know what you are entitled to from the original payment recipient as a refund or why the recipient sent the refund in a particular amount.\nor</li>\n<li>transaction exchange rate fluctuations.\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>PayPal is not responsible for any loss resulting from the recipient's decision to refuse or refund your payment, except to the extent that a refund sent by the recipient is a payment executed incorrectly by PayPal </p>\n<p>We are not liable to you for the difference between the value of your original payment and the value of the resulting refund, except to the extent that the refund is an incorrect payment (see the section on Resolving Problems).\n</p> Funding Your Payment Selecting a preferred funding source <p>You may select a preferred funding source when logged into your account.\nSubject to this user agreement, the preferred funding source will be used as the default funding source for payments you send from your account.</p>\n<p> You can set separate preferred funding sources for some billing agreement payments.\n</p> Special Funding Arrangements <p> Some payments can be funded by special funding arrangements linked to your PayPal account, such as merchant/transaction specific balance, gift vouchers or other promotional funding arrangements.\nThe use and priority of these special funding arrangements are subject to further terms and conditions between you and us.\nYour account overview may show the notional amount available in your special funding arrangements to fund qualifying payments at any given time.\nThis amount does not constitute electronic money, is not deemed part of your PayPal balance and is not redeemable in cash - it only represents the amount of electronic money which we offer to issue and credit to your account at the time of (and only to immediately fund) a qualifying payment, subject to (and only for the period outlined in) the further terms and conditions of use of that special funding arrangement.\nIf your payment funded by a special funding arrangement is reversed at a later time for any reason, we will keep the amount that represents the portion of that payment that was funded by your special funding arrangement and (provided that the special funding arrangement has not already expired) reinstate the special funding arrangement.</p> Funding payments you send from your account <p> We will obtain electronic money for the payment you send from your account from the following sources in the following order to the extent they are available:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Special Funding Arrangements (if available for the given transaction)</li>\n<li>Preferred funding source (if selected and available)</li>\n<li>Pre-existing PayPal balance</li>\n<li>Bank account (instant transfer via bank mandate)</li>\n<li>PayPal Credit (where available)</li>\n<li>PayPal-branded debit card (where available)</li>\n<li>PayPal-branded credit card (where available)</li>\n<li>Debit card</li>\n<li>Credit card</li>\n<li>Bank account (eCheque) </li>\n</ol>\n<p>If you have linked a bank account as a funding source we may choose to offer you access to Pay After Delivery, which allows you to defer a charge to this bank account for a period of time.\nIf you are offered and choose to use this service, the Pay After Delivery Terms will apply.</p> PayPal Buyer Protection <p>When you buy something from a seller who accepts PayPal, you may be eligible for a refund under PayPal Buyer Protection.\nWhen applicable, PayPal Buyer Protection program entitles you to reimbursement for the full purchase price of the item plus the original shipping costs you paid, if any.\nPayPal determines, in its sole discretion, whether your claim qualifies for PayPal Buyer Protection.\nPayPal\u2019s original determination is considered final, but you may be able to file an appeal of the decision with PayPal if you have new or compelling information not available at the time of the original determination or you believe there was an error in the decision-making process.</p>\n<p>IMPORTANT: You may be required to return the item to the seller or other party we specify as part of the settlement of your claim.\nPayPal Buyer Protection does not entitle you to reimbursement for the return shipping costs that you may incur.</p>\n<p>PayPal Buyer Protection program may apply when you encounter these specific problems with a transaction:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>You didn\u2019t receive your item from a seller (referred to as an \u201cItem Not Received\u201d claim), or</li>\n<li>You received an item, but the item isn\u2019t what you ordered (referred to as a \u201cSignificantly Not as Described\u201d claim).</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If you believe that a transaction made through your PayPal account was not authorized by you, this type of claim is different from the PayPal Buyer Protection, and is described below under Liability for Unauthorized Transactions and Other Errors.</p> QR Code Transactions <p>If you buy something from a seller in-person by using a PayPal goods and services QR, your transaction may be eligible for PayPal Buyer Protection.</p>Item Not Received claims <p>Your claim <em>\n<strong>will not</strong>\n</em> qualify for a refund under PayPal Buyer Protection for an Item Not Received claim, if:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>You collect the item in person, or arrange for it to be collected on your behalf, including if you use PayPal in a seller\u2019s retail point of sale, except for in-person PayPal QR code goods and services transactions or</li>\n<li>The seller has provided proof of delivery.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If the seller presents evidence that they delivered the goods to you, PayPal may find in favor of the seller for an Item Not Received claim even if you claim you did not receive the goods.</p> Significantly Not as Described claims <p>An item may be considered Significantly Not as Described if:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The item is materially different from the seller\u2019s description of it.</li>\n<li>You received a completely different item.</li>\n<li>The condition of the item was misrepresented.\nFor example, the item was described as \u201cnew\u201d but the item was used.</li>\n<li>The item was advertised as authentic but is not authentic (i.e.\ncounterfeit).</li>\n<li>The item is missing major parts or features and those facts were not disclosed in the description of the item when you bought it.</li>\n<li>You purchased a certain number of items but didn\u2019t receive them all.</li>\n<li>The item was damaged during shipment.</li>\n<li>The item is unusable in its received state and was not disclosed as such.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>An item may not be considered Significantly Not as Described if:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The defect in the item was correctly described by the seller in its description of the item.</li>\n<li>The item was properly described but you didn't want it after you received it.</li>\n<li>The item was properly described but did not meet your expectations.</li>\n<li>The item has minor scratches and was described as \u201cused.\"</li>\n</ul>\n<p>&nbsp;</p> Ineligible items and transactions under PayPal Buyer Protection <p>Payments for the following are not eligible for reimbursement under PayPal Buyer Protection:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Real estate, including residential property.</li>\n<li>Financial products or investments of any kind.</li>\n<li>Businesses (when you buy or invest in a business).</li>\n<li>Vehicles, including, but not limited to, motor vehicles, motorcycles, recreational vehicles, aircraft and boats, except for personally portable light vehicles used for recreational purposes like bicycles and wheeled hoverboards.</li>\n<li>Significantly Not as Described claims for wholly or partly custom-made items or items picked up in person.</li>\n<li>Donations including payments on crowdfunding platforms, as well as payments made on crowdlending platforms.</li>\n<li>Items prohibited by the PayPal&nbsp;<strong>Acceptable Use Policy</strong>.</li>\n<li>For Item Not Received claims, items which you collect in person or arrange to be collected on your behalf, including items bought in a seller\u2019s retail point of sale, , except for in-person PayPal QR code goods and services transactions.</li>\n<li>Industrial machinery used in manufacturing.</li>\n<li>Payments to state-run bodies, (except for state-owned enterprises) or traders acting on mandates received from state-run bodies.</li>\n<li>Payment equivalent to cash, including stored value items such as gift cards and pre-paid cards.&nbsp;</li>\n<li>Gambling, gaming and/or any other activity with an entry fee and a prize.</li>\n<li>Personal Payments.&nbsp;</li>\n<li>Payments made using PayPal Payouts and Mass Pay&nbsp.\ni.e.\nnot sent using your PayPal account.</li>\n<li>Items intended for resale, including single item transactions or transactions that include multiple items.</li>\n<li>Payments made in respect of gold (whether in physical form or in exchange-traded form).</li>\n</ul> Transaction eligibility for PayPal Buyer Protection <p>To be eligible for PayPal Buyer Protection you must meet all of the following requirements:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Have a PayPal account in good standing.</li>\n<li>Pay for the eligible item from your PayPal account.</li>\n<li>Attempt to contact the seller to resolve your issue directly before filing a claim under PayPal\u2019s Purchase Protection through the Resolution Center.</li>\n<li>Respond to PayPal's request for documentation and other information within the time requested.</li>\n<li>Open a dispute in the Resolution Center within 180 days of the date you sent the payment, then follow our online dispute resolution process.</li>\n<li>Not have received a recovery related to such purchase from another source.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>&nbsp;</p> Our online dispute resolution process <p>If you\u2019re unable to resolve a transaction related issue directly with a seller, you must follow our online dispute resolution process through the&nbsp;<strong>Resolution Center</strong>&nbsp;to pursue a claim under our PayPal Buyer Protection.\nYou may also file a claim (Step 2 below) by calling us and speaking to an agent.\nThe steps you must follow are described below, and if you do not follow these steps your claim may be denied:</p>\n<p>Step 1: <strong>Open a dispute</strong> within&nbsp;180 days&nbsp;of the date you made the payment.\nThis might allow you to start a direct conversation with the seller regarding your issue with the transaction that may help resolve the dispute.\nIf you are unable to resolve the dispute directly with the seller, proceed to Step 2.\nWe will place a hold on all funds related to the transaction in the seller's PayPal&nbsp;account until the dispute is resolved or closed.</p>\n<p>Step 2: <strong>Escalate the dispute to a claim</strong> for reimbursement within 20 days&nbsp;after opening the dispute, if you and the seller are unable to come to an agreement, or we will automatically close the dispute.\nYou can escalate the dispute to a claim for reimbursement through the <strong>Resolution Center</strong>.\nThe seller or PayPal may also escalate the dispute to a claim at this point.\nIf you are making an Item Not Received claim, PayPal may ask you to wait at least 7 days from the transaction date to escalate the dispute.</p>\n<p>Step 3:&nbsp;<strong>Respond to PayPal\u2019s requests for documentation or other information</strong>, after you, the seller or PayPal escalates your dispute to a claim for reimbursement.\nPayPal may require you to provide receipts, third party evaluations, police reports or other documents that PayPal specifies.\nYou must respond to these requests in a timely manner as requested in our correspondence with you.</p>\n<p>Step 4:&nbsp;<strong>Comply with PayPal\u2019s shipping requests in a timely manner</strong>, if you\u2019re filing a Significantly Not as Described claim.\nPayPal may require you, at your expense, to ship the item&nbsp;back to the seller, to PayPal or to a third party (which will be specified by PayPal) and to provide Proof of Delivery.</p>\n<p>Step 5:&nbsp;<strong>PayPal will make a final decision&nbsp;</strong>(including automatically closing any dispute or claim), in its sole discretion, based on the coverage and eligibility requirements set forth above, any additional information provided during the online dispute resolution process or any other information PayPal deems relevant and appropriate under the circumstances.</p> Event tickets <p>In certain cases, if you purchase a ticket or pay for the right to attend an event from a payment recipient who is a UK registered PayPal account holder (\u201cEvent\u201d), all monies paid by you may be held by PayPal on trust for you, so that the beneficial interest in such monies remains with you until the performance of the Event in question.</p>Dispute with us or your card issuer <p>If you used a debit or credit card as the payment method for a transaction through your PayPal account and you are dissatisfied with the transaction, you may be entitled to dispute the transaction with your card issuer.\nApplicable card chargeback rights may be broader than those available to you under PayPal\u2019s Buyer Protection.\nFor example, if you dispute a transaction with your card issuer, you may be able to recover amounts you paid for unsatisfactory items even if they don\u2019t qualify for protection under a Significantly Not as Described claim with us.</p>\n<p>You must choose whether to pursue a dispute with PayPal under our PayPal Buyer Protection, or to pursue the dispute with your card issuer.\nYou can\u2019t do both at the same time or seek a double recovery.\nIf you pursue a dispute/claim with us and you also pursue a dispute for the same transaction with your card issuer, we\u2019ll close your dispute/claim with us.\nThis won\u2019t affect the dispute process with your card issuer.\nIn addition, if you pursue a dispute with your card issuer, you cannot pursue a dispute/claim with us later.</p>\n<p>If you choose to dispute a transaction with PayPal and we decide against you, you can seek to pursue the dispute with your card issuer later.\nIf PayPal does not make a final decision on your claim until after your card issuer's deadline for filing a dispute, and because of our delay you recover less than the full amount you would have been entitled to recover from the card issuer, we will reimburse you for the remainder of your loss (minus any amount you have already recovered from the seller or your card issuer).</p>\n<p>Before contacting your card issuer or filing a dispute with PayPal, you should contact the seller to attempt to resolve your issue in accordance with the seller\u2019s return policy.</p> PAYPAL USER AGREEMENT\nReceiving Payments General provisions for receiving payments <p>PayPal may allow anybody (with or without an account) to make a payment resulting in the issuance or transfer of electronic money to your account.\n</p>\n<p>By integrating (including by having already integrated) into your online checkout/platform any functionality intended to enable a payer without a PayPal account to send a payment to your PayPal account, you agree to all further terms of use of that functionality which PayPal will make available to you on any page on the PayPal or Braintree website (including any page for developers and our Legal Agreements page) or online platform.\nSuch further terms include the PayPal Alternative Payment Methods Agreement.\n</p>\n<p>The receipt of a payment into your account does not equate to the receipt of cleared funds.\nA notification that a payment has been sent to you does not amount to a receipt of electronic money in your account unless you have accepted the payment.\n</p>\n<p>We may allow you to accept payments in any currency supported by our Service from time to time.\n</p>\n<p>Where you (instead of PayPal) offer the payer at the point of sale a currency conversion of an amount you receive through PayPal, you will inform the buyer of the exchange rate and any charges that will be applied to the payment transaction.\nPayPal has no liability to any buyer if you fail to inform the buyer of the exchange rate and charges.\nYou acknowledge that if you fail to disclose the exchange rate and charges to the buyer this may constitute a criminal offence by you.</p>\n<p>Any payment sent to you may be subject to a reversal, payment review, limitation, reserve or hold as allowed under this user agreement.\n</p>Receiving limits <p>We may, at our discretion, impose limits on the amount and value of payments you can receive, including money you receive for purchases.\nTo lift your receiving limit, you must follow the steps that we will notify to you or publish from time to time (which we may set out in your account overview).</p>\n<strong>New checkout solution included in the PayPal Commerce Platform</strong>\n<p>The PayPal Commerce Platform includes our new checkout solution.&nbsp.\nThe checkout solution consists of:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>our dedicated bundled checkout capability in your online checkout/platform to enable a buyer with or without an account to send a payment to your account.\nand</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Fraud Protection.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>We may offer you all, any part or any combination of parts of the checkout solution.\nIf we offer you the checkout solution and you choose to use it, in addition to this user agreement, you agree to the following further terms relating to the following capabilities:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>the&nbsp;<strong>PayPal Alternative Payment Methods Agreement</strong>, when you use our APM functionality as part of the checkout solution.\nand</li>\n<li>the&nbsp;<strong>PayPal Online Card Payment Services Agreement</strong>, when you use: <ul>\n<li>our Advanced Credit and Debit Card Payments as part of the checkout solution bundle.\nand</li>\n<li>Fraud Protection as part of the checkout solution.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Our <strong>Fees</strong>&nbsp;for using the checkout solution apply.</p> Rules about surcharging <p>PayPal does not encourage surcharging because it is a commercial practice that can penalise the consumer and create unnecessary confusion, friction and abandonment at checkout.\n</p>\n<p>You may only surcharge for the use of our services in compliance with any law applicable to you and not in excess of the surcharges that you apply for the use of other payment methods.</p>\n<p>If you surcharge a buyer, you, and not we, will inform the buyer of the requested charge.\nWe are not liable to any buyer where you have failed to inform the buyer of any surcharge.\nYou acknowledge that you could be committing a criminal offence if you surcharge and/or fail to disclose any form of surcharge to a buyer.</p> Presentation of PayPal <p>You must treat PayPal as a payment method or mark at least on par with any other payment methods offered at your points of sale, including your websites or mobile applications.\nThis includes at least equal or substantially similar:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>logo placement,</li>\n<li>position within any point of sale,</li>\n<li>treatment in terms of payment flow, terms, conditions, restrictions, or fees, in each case as compared to other marks and payment methods at your points of sale.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In representations to your customers or in public communications, you must not mischaracterise PayPal as a payment method or exhibit a preference for other payment methods over PayPal.</p> Taxes and information reporting <p>It is your responsibility to determine what, if any, taxes apply to the payments you make or receive, and it is solely your responsibility to assess, collect, report and remit the correct taxes to the appropriate authority.\nWe are not responsible for determining whether any taxes apply to your transaction, or for calculating, collecting, reporting or remitting taxes arising from any transaction.\nAs a bank service provider no sales tax applies to the PayPal services in the EU.</p> Your refund policy and privacy policy <p>You must publish a refunds and return policy, as well as a privacy policy.</p> In-store payments and QR code transactions <p>If you accept PayPal payments at your physical store, you must communicate the total amount of the transaction to the customer before it takes place.\nYou may charge your customer's account only for transactions that they have authorized.\nYou must also provide customers with a physical receipt if they request one.\nYou agree that any transaction that you make shall have an accurate and true description of the goods and services being purchased.</p>\n<p>If you use a QR code to accept payments in your physical store, you must use a QR code intended for goods and services transactions.\nYou must also not use QR codes for in-person transactions as a method of accepting payment for goods and services transactions occurring online.\nFor any buyer claims related to QR code transactions you may be required to provide us with alternative evidence of delivery, or such additional documentation or information relating to the transaction.</p> Marketplace sellers <p>If you\u2019re a seller on a marketplace or through a third-party application where PayPal is offered, you must comply with any rules that apply to the marketplace\u2019s or the third party application\u2019s buyer protection program for sales you make through that forum.\nAny such protections may require you to take certain actions and may impact how claims are processed.</p>\n<p>We may allow you to authorise certain marketplaces to use your account to pay amounts you owe to the marketplace or to the buyer (as the case may be) arising from a claim under the terms of the marketplace\u2019s own resolution process (\u201c<strong>Marketplace Due Amounts</strong>\u201d).\nIf you give such an authorisation and the marketplace notifies us of the claim, you instruct us to process payments of all and any Marketplace Due Amounts relating to that claim from your PayPal account to that marketplace or to the buyer (as the case may be) according to the marketplace\u2019s instructions to us.\nWe may treat your instruction for the payment of any given Marketplace Due Amount as cancelled if we decide that the claim would have been determined in your favour had it been filed as a claim with us.\nYou can also cancel this instruction by contacting us.\nAll claims filed directly with the marketplace are governed by the marketplace\u2019s own policy only.\nThe terms of the PayPal Seller Protection Programme do not cover you for claims filed by your buyers directly with the marketplace.</p> Accepting billing agreement payments <p>If we allow you to accept payments from a payer under a billing agreement, when you present to us a payment request under that billing agreement, you:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>warrant to us that the amounts you present have been agreed and consented to by the payer whose account will be deducted (including changes to those amounts) and that you will give prior notice of the deduction to the payer.\nand</li>\n<li>agree that you will notify the payer at least 4 weeks in advance of the amount they will collect if that amount has increased in such a manner that the payer could not have reasonably expected to pay such an amount, taking into account the payer\u2019s previous spending patterns and the circumstances of the payment and that you are liable to us for any refunds of that payment in accordance with the terms of this user agreement.</li>\n</ul> Refunds and reversals of payments <p>When you receive a payment, it could be refunded or reversed.\nWe may allow you to send to the payer a refund of the payment.\nWe may carry out a reversal of your payment in certain circumstances.\nSee the rest of this section for more details.</p>Refunds <p>You alone are (and PayPal is not) responsible for:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>your legal and contractual obligations towards the payer for any amount you return to the payer.\nand</li>\n<li>any difference between the cost to the payer of making the original payment and the value of the amount returned to the payer (for instance, as a result of transaction exchange rate fluctuations) except to the extent that the refund is an incorrect payment (see the section on Resolving Problems).<br>\n<br>See our fees for details of the fees you paid to us as the recipient of the original payment which we retain when you use the special commercial transaction refund functionality in your PayPal account, as we may allow from time to time.\nexcept to the extent that the refund is an incorrect payment (see the section on Resolving Problems).</li>\n</ul>Reversals <p>If you receive a payment in your account, you owe us the full amount of the payment and our losses arising from processing the payment.\nThis can include our liability (including any fees, charges and penalties) towards any third party (including the payer and the payer\u2019s funding source provider).</p>\n<p>A reversal happens when we exercise our right to set off the above amounts from your account under the section Reimbursement for your liability in this user agreement.\nIf your PayPal balance for a particular currency is insufficient to cover the amount you owe us in that currency, we may perform a currency conversion from any PayPal balance in another currency to cover the shortfall and you will be charged for the currency conversion.\nThis means that, for example, if you are a seller, amounts of payments received in your account may be removed from your account after you have delivered any goods or services sold.</p>\n<p>A reversal can happen when:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>we reimburse the payer in respect of a PayPal Buyer Protection claim the payer made against you.</li>\n<li>we compensate the payer or the payer\u2019s funding source provider (or both) because we receive a claim from the payer or their funding source provider for the payment amount under the reversal process used by that funding source provider.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>For instance:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>if the payer used a card to fund the payment to you the payer could pursue a \u201cchargeback\u201d with the card issuer.\nThe card issuer, not us, determines whether the payer is successful when they pursue a chargeback.\nYou can find out more about chargebacks by reviewing our Chargeback Guide, accessible via the PayPal Security Centre and the section called: \u201cSelling Safely\u201d.\nThe PayPal Security Centre is accessed via the PayPal website.\nWe charge you a fee for receiving a chargeback claim.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>If the payer used a bank account to fund the payment the payer or the bank could pursue a bank reversal.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The amount claimed may be greater than the original amount you received due to currency exchange rate fluctuations between the time of payment and the time of the claim.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>we may have to compensate your payer when they claimed that there was a problem with their payment (including that their payment was unauthorised or incorrect or that their billing agreement payment was not expected) \u2013 see Resolving Problems.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>we are entitled to carry out the reversal for any other reason under this user agreement, including the provision Actions We May Take if You Engage in Any Restricted Activities.</li>\n</ul> Impact of PayPal Buyer Protection on sellers <p> You should read our Buyer Protection Policy and if you sell goods and services to buyers with PayPal accounts in countries other than your own, you also should be familiar with the purchase protection made available by PayPal to buyers in each of those countries as buyers\u2019 rights under these programs may impact you as a seller.\nYou can find information about the PayPal Buyer Protection on the Legal Agreements page by selecting your buyer\u2019s location at the top of the page and referring to the corresponding PayPal Buyer Protection listed on that page or in the corresponding user agreement.\n</p>\n<p>If you lose a claim under&nbsp;PayPal Buyer Protection&nbsp.\nin any country:</p>\n<p>\u00b7&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp.\nYou must forfeit the full purchase price of the item plus the original shipping cost.\nIn some cases you may not receive the item back.</p>\n<p>\u00b7&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp.\nYou will not receive a refund of the PayPal fees that you paid in connection with the sale.</p>\n<p>\u00b7&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp.\nIf the claim was that the item received was Significantly Not as Described, you may not receive the item back, or you may be required to accept the item back plus pay for return shipping costs.</p>\n<p>\u00b7&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp.\nIf the claim was that the item received was Significantly Not as Described and related to an item you sold that is counterfeit, you will be required to provide a full refund to the buyer and you may not receive the item back.</p>\n<p>If you accept PayPal payments from buyers for goods or services you sell through eBay, then you need to read and understand the eBay Money Back Guarantee program.\nUnless you opt out by calling eBay, PayPal will treat eBay\u2019s decisions in favor of your buyers under that program as a basis for reversing a PayPal payment made to you.\nIf the balance in your cash account or business PayPal account is insufficient to cover the amount, we may:</p>\n<p>\u00b7&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp.\nplace a&nbsp;hold&nbsp;on your PayPal account until sufficient funds become available in your PayPal account to cover the amount.\nor</p>\n<p>create a negative balance in your PayPal account.</p> PayPal Seller Protection What\u2019s eligible <p>If you have received more than \u20ac100,000 per month at least once over a consecutive period of 6 months on your PayPal Account and/or if you are applying surcharge for the use of PayPal (when the law applicable to you allows you to apply surcharge), you are not eligible for PayPal seller protection and this section applies to you unless otherwise agreed between you and PayPal.\nPayPal will review your eligibility for seller protection in October and April of each calendar year.</p>\n<p>If you sell something to a buyer and the transaction is later disputed or reversed under Reversals, Claims or Chargebacks,&nbsp;you may be eligible for reimbursement under PayPal Seller Protection.\nWhen it applies, PayPal Seller Protection entitles you to retain the full purchase amount.\nThere is no limit on the number of payments for which you can receive coverage.\nBy accessing the transaction details page in your PayPal account you can determine whether or not your transaction is eligible for protection under this program</p>\n<p>PayPal Seller Protection may apply when a buyer claims that:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>They did not authorize, or benefit from, funds sent from their PayPal account (referred to as an \u201cUnauthorized Transaction\u201d claim) and the Unauthorized Transaction occurs in an environment hosted by PayPal.\nor</li>\n<li>They didn\u2019t receive the item from you (referred to as an \u201cItem Not Received\u201d claim).</li>\n</ul>\n<p>PayPal Seller Protection may also apply when a transaction is reversed because of a successful chargeback by a buyer or when a bank funded payment is reversed by the buyer\u2019s bank.</p>\n<p>This section describes PayPal Seller Protection as it applies to you, but you should also be familiar with the Impact of various PayPal Buyer protection processes on sellers.</p> Basic requirements <p>To be eligible for PayPal Seller Protection, all of the following basic requirements must be met, as well as any applicable additional

the purchase (partial payment and/or payment in installments are excluded).</li>\n</ul>\n<p>PayPal determines, in its sole discretion, whether your claim qualifies for the Seller Protection

determined by card scheme rules) has passed.\nThis depends on certain factors, including, without limitation: <ul>\n<li>a.\nThe type of goods or services for which you receive payment.\nor</li>\n<li>b.\nThe timeframe for delivery of the goods or performance of the services for which you receive payment (e.g.\nsales of event tickets months in advance of the event date can

from a payment that you receive can last for the time that it takes for the parties to close the claim or dispute and all appeals associated with that claim or dispute in accordance with PayPal Buyer

PayPal account you control.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Please also see the section below on <u>Your liability</u>.</p>\n<p>Unless otherwise directed by us, you must not use or attempt to use your account while it is suspended or has been closed.\nYou must ensure that all agreements with sellers or other third parties that involve third party initiated payments (including billing agreement payments) set up from your account are cancelled immediately upon the termination, suspension or closure of your account.\nYou remain liable under this user agreement in respect of all charges and other amounts incurred through the use of your account at any time, irrespective of termination, suspension or closure.</p> Holds, Limitations, and Reserves What are holds, limitations and reserves? <p>Under certain circumstances, in order to protect PayPal and the security and integrity of the network of buyers and sellers that use the PayPal services, PayPal may take account-level or transaction-level actions.\nIf we take any of the actions described here, we will normally notify you of our actions, but we may, if it is reasonable to do so (for example if you are in breach of this user agreement or we consider it advisable for security reasons), take any of these actions without prior notice to you.</p>\n<p>To request information in connection with an account limitation, hold or reserve, you should visit the Resolution Centre or follow the instructions in our email notice with respect to the limitation, hold or reserve.</p>\n<p>You acknowledge and agree that any funds held under this user agreement may be placed in your reserve account and that you will provide to us any information as we may reasonably request to allow us to determine whether the risk has passed.</p>Holds <p>A hold is an action that PayPal may take under certain circumstances either at the transaction level or the account level.&nbsp.\nWhen PayPal places a hold on a payment amount, the money is not available to either the sender or the recipient.\n&nbsp;PayPal reviews many factors before placing a hold on a payment, including: account tenure, transaction activity, business type, past customer disputes, and overall customer satisfaction.\nSome common situations where PayPal will hold payments include where we have reason to believe that:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Transactions are higher risk, this can be where the transaction involves the sale of goods or services in a high risk category, or other facts known to us typically resulting in an increased number of chargebacks, other claims or disputes or to be often involved in fraud or illegal activity;</li>\n<li>There is a sudden and abnormal change in a PayPal account holder\u2019s selling activity including an increase in the number of chargebacks, reversals, or buyer complaints received in relation to such PayPal account;</li>\n<li>Any PayPal account is being used in relation to restricted activities;</li>\n<li>A PayPal account involved in the transaction may have been compromised, or that stolen financial details (bank or credit card) are used for the payment, or otherwise a transaction has not been properly authorised;</li>\n<li>A user is trying to send or withdraw funds they received fraudulently;</li>\n<li>A user has not provided sufficient Information to us to enable us to verify their identity or the identity of their business and/or the user has a limited trading history with PayPal;</li>\n<li>A payment sent to you as a seller is challenged as a payment that should be invalidated and reversed.</li>\n<li>Your buyer files a chargeback, reversal or PayPal Buyer Protection claim on a payment you received.&nbsp;</li>\n<li>Your buyer files a claim under a marketplace's resolution process.</li>\n<li>There is a risk of reversal of funds in your account to your funding source.</li>\n<li>There is a risk of liability (a non-exhaustive list of examples of such risk is set out in the section Actions We May Take If You Engage In Any Restricted Activities above).</li>\n</ul>Payment review <p>When we identify a potentially high-risk transaction, we review the transaction more closely before allowing it to proceed.\nThis may be because we have the reasonable suspicion that the payer\u2019s PayPal account is being used in relation to restricted activities or for other reasons as determined by us in our reasonable discretion.&nbsp.\nThis may include where there is a risk of liability (a non-exhaustive list of examples of such risk is set out in the section Actions We May Take If You Engage In Any Restricted Activities above).</p>\n<p>If a payment is subject to payment review, we may:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>execute the payment order initiated by the buyer;</li>\n<li>in our discretion, immediately upon such execution restrict the payer\u2019s account;</li>\n<li>place a hold on the payment [in the payer\u2019s account].\nand/or</li>\n<li>notify the recipient to delay the delivery of the purchase paid for by the payment.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>As a buyer, this may delay your receipt of the item you purchased.\nIf we clear the transaction, we will notify the seller and direct them to ship the item.\n&nbsp;</p>\n<p>If we don\u2019t clear the transaction, we will cancel it and return the funds to you, unless we are legally required to take other action.</p>\n<p>All payments that complete payment review are still subject to being reversed under the terms of this user agreement but will be Seller Protection eligible if they meet the Seller Protection requirements.\nPayPal will provide notices to you by email and/or in the transaction history tab of your PayPal account.\nA payment subject to payment review is a review of the payment only and is implemented to reduce the risk of PayPal users receiving high risk transactions.\nA payment subject to payment review is neither a review nor a representation by PayPal as to the commercial dealings, character or reputation of a party to the payment transaction and should not be considered as a lessening of the respect of any person.</p>Holds related to your instructions <p>Certain PayPal functionality may allow you (whether directly or via someone you permit to act on your behalf, like an online marketplace platform on which you transact as a seller) to instruct us to hold your funds (including the proceeds of payments you receive using PayPal) in your reserve account.</p>\n<p>In such a case we will show you the availability status of those funds in your balance \u2013 the status descriptions may differ according to the functionality you used to instruct us to place the hold.\nWe will release the hold on the funds according to the instruction that you (or the entity that you have permitted to act on your behalf) give to us, subject to the rest of this user agreement.</p> Account Limitations <p>Limitations are implemented to help protect PayPal, buyers and sellers when we notice&nbsp;<strong>restricted activities</strong>, an increased financial risk, or activity that appears to us as unusual or suspicious.&nbsp.\nLimitations also help us collect information necessary for keeping your PayPal account open.</p>\n<p>There are several reasons why your PayPal account could be limited, including where we have reason to believe that:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Someone could be using your PayPal account without your knowledge, then we\u2019ll limit it for your protection and look into the fraudulent activity.</li>\n<li>Someone has used your card or bank account without your permission, for example if your debit or credit card issuer or bank alerts us to this.</li>\n<li>You have breached this user agreement or violated the&nbsp;<strong>Acceptable Use Policy.</strong>\n</li>\n<li>Your performance as a seller indicate your PayPal account is high risk.\nExamples include: indications of poor selling performance because you\u2019ve received an unusually high number of claims and chargebacks, selling an entirely new or high-cost product type, or if your typical sales volume increases rapidly.</li>\n<li>There is a risk of liability (a non-exhaustive list of examples of such risk is set out in the section Actions We May Take If You Engage In Any Restricted Activities&nbsp;above).</li>\n</ul>\n<p>We may also limit your PayPal account in order to comply with applicable law.</p>\n<p>You will need to resolve any issues with your account before a limitation can be removed.\nNormally, this is done after you provide us with the information we request.\nHowever, if we reasonably believe a risk still exists after you have provided us that information, we may take action to protect PayPal, our users, a third party, or you from reversals, fees, fines, penalties, legal and/or regulatory risks and any other liability.</p>Reserves <p>We may place a reserve on your PayPal account at any time if we believe there may be a high level of risk associated with you, your PayPal account, your business model, or your transactions.&nbsp.\nWhen we place a reserve on your PayPal account, it means that all or some portion of the funds in your PayPal account is reserved as unavailable for withdrawal in order to protect against the risk of transactions made by you being reversed or invalidated or any other risk related to your PayPal account or use of the PayPal services.&nbsp;&nbsp.\nWe make decisions about whether to place a reserve based on a number of factors, including information available to us from both internal sources and from third parties.</p>\n<p>PayPal considers a list of non-exclusive factors and whether and how these factors have changed over time, including:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>How long you have been in business.</li>\n<li>Whether your industry has a higher likelihood of chargebacks.</li>\n<li>Your payment processing history with PayPal and other providers.</li>\n<li>Your business and/or personal credit history.</li>\n<li>Your delivery time frames.</li>\n<li>Whether you have higher than average number of returns, chargebacks, claims or disputes.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>There are two types of reserves that may be placed on your PayPal account, and one or both may be applied at the same time:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>A \u201crolling reserve\u201d</strong>&nbsp;is a reserve where a percentage of each transaction you receive each day is held and then released later on a scheduled basis.\nFor example, your reserve could be set at 10% and held for a 90-day rolling period \u2013 meaning 10% of the money you receive on day 1 is held and then released on day 91, 10% of the money you receive on day 2 is held until day 92, etc.\nRolling reserves are the most common type of reserve.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>A \u201cminimum reserve\u201d</strong>&nbsp;is a specific minimum amount of funds that you\u2019re required to keep available in your balance at all times.\nThe minimum reserve is either taken as an upfront amount deposited all at once or is established on a rolling basis from percentages of sales until the minimum reserve is achieved, much like a rolling reserve.&nbsp;</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If we place a reserve on funds in your PayPal account, the money will be moved to your reserve account and shown as \u201cpending\u201d and we\u2019ll notify you about it.</p>\n<p>If we change the reserve due to a change in our risk assessment, we\u2019ll notify you about it as well.</p>\n<p>You will undertake, at your own expense, any further action required to establish a reserve or other form of security in a manner reasonably determined by us.&nbsp.\nThis can involve executing any necessary documents and registering any form of document reasonably required by us to allow us to perfect any form of security interest.</p> PAYPAL USER AGREEMENT\nRESOLVING PROBLEMS <strong>\n<p>We strongly recommend that you monitor your account closely on a regular basis.</p>\n</strong> If you find a problem\u2026 <p>If you have any reason to believe that there is a problem with your account or our service, follow these steps:</p> Step 1: Take a few moments to identify the type of problem: <ul>\n<li>\n<strong>\n<u>Unexpected billing agreement payment</u>\n</strong>\n<br>\n<p>This is where you entered into a billing agreement but a payment was sent from your account to another PayPal account under that billing agreement where:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>you didn\u2019t agree with the recipient in advance the exact payment amount.\nand</li>\n<li>the payment amount ended up being more than you could reasonably have expected to pay based on previous charges and the other circumstances.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>\n<u>Incorrect payment</u>\n</strong>\n<br>\n<p>This is where a payment sent from your account to another PayPal account was not sent as you specified when you asked us to make it (e.g.\nfor the wrong amount, delayed, wrong recipient) or you received such a payment.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>\n<u>Security / Fraud problem</u>\n</strong>\n<br>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>\n<u>Unauthorised payment</u>\n</strong>\n<br>\n<p>This is where a payment sent from your account wasn\u2019t authorised by you (or anyone who\u2019s authorised to make payments for you).</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>\n<u>Another type of security / fraud problem</u>\n</strong>\n<br>\n<p>This is where there was another security or fraud problem, such as:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>there was some other unauthorised access to your account.</li>\n<li>your password or PIN was compromised.</li>\n<li>a device you have used to access our services was lost, stolen or deactivated.</li>\n</ul>\n<br>\n<p>Follow the steps in the section \u201c<strong>What to do in case of a security problem</strong>\u201d in the <strong>\n<u>Key Payment and Service Information</u>\n</strong>&nbsp;as soon as possible before contacting us.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>\n<u>Another type of problem </u>\n</strong>\n<br>\n<p>This is where there was another type of problem with your account or with our service which is not mentioned above.\nFor instance, we may have made a factual, computational or mathematical error related to your PayPal when you added money to or withdrew money from your PayPal account.</p>\n<p>If a purchase that you paid for with PayPal was not as described or you have not received the purchase, the PayPal Buyer Protection Policy, not this section, may apply.&nbsp.\nPlease see the PayPal Buyer Protection Policy&nbsp;for how to deal with these particular problems.</p>\n</li>\n</ul> Step 2: Tell us about the problem <p>\n<strong>\n<u>Contact us&nbsp;as soon as possible</u>\n</strong> to tell us about the problem (including the type of problem you are contacting us about so that we can help you as quickly as we can).</p>\n<p>You must give us all the information we reasonably request as to the circumstances of the problem and take all reasonable steps we request to assist us in our investigation.</p>\n<p>If you tell us about your problem orally, we may require that you report your problem in writing within 10&nbsp;<strong>Business Days</strong> after that.</p>\n<p>We may provide third parties with information we consider relevant in such circumstances in accordance with our <strong>\n<u>Privacy Policy</u>\n</strong>&nbsp;(alternatively known as our Privacy Statement).</p> How we will help...\n<p>Subject to the rest of this user agreement, we aim to investigate the problem and work with you to resolve it within 60 days.\nIn addition, if your problem is:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>\n<u>an unexpected billing agreement payment, </u>\n</strong>&nbsp;within 10 Business Days after telling us about it we will either: <ul>\n<li>reimburse you for the payment amount.\nor</li>\n<li>explain why we cannot reimburse you.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>\n<u>an incorrect payment to another Paypal account, </u>\n</strong>we will:</li>\n<ul>\n<li>make immediate efforts to trace the payment and notify you of the outcome without charge to you;</li>\n<li>compensate you as soon as possible (and in any event no later than the end of the Business Day after you tell us about the problem) by putting your account in the state it would have been in had the incorrect payment been sent as actually specified by the sender.\nThis means: <ul>\n<li>If the incorrect payment resulted in you having less money than you would have had if the payment had been made as actually specified, we will credit your account for the difference.</li>\n<li>If the incorrect payment resulted in you having more money than you would have had if the payment had been made as actually specified, we may debit the extra funds from your&nbsp;account.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>reimburse you in your account for your losses or damages directly and reasonably foreseeably caused by the incorrect payment.</li>\n</ul>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>\n<u>an unauthorised payment to another PayPal account, </u>\n</strong>as soon as possible (and in any event no later than the end of the Business Day after you tell us about the problem) we will put your account back to where it would have been had the payment never happened.&nbsp.\nThis can include a <u>reimbursement</u> of your payment.</li>\n</ul> When we can\u2019t compensate you...\n<p>You are not entitled to any financial compensation from us as outlined above and you will owe to us (and we may reverse from your account) any compensation you have already received from us if:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>You do not give us all the information we reasonably requested as to the circumstances of the problem (including, if you tell us about your problem orally, you fail to comply with our request that you tell us about your problem in writing within 10&nbsp;<strong>Business Days</strong>);</li>\n<li>You do not take all reasonable steps that we request to assist us in our investigation;</li>\n<li>We can show that you acted fraudulently;</li>\n<li>We can show that circumstances beyond our control (such as fire or flood or loss of internet connection) caused the problem, despite our reasonable precautions;</li>\n<li>We have reason to believe otherwise that there is no problem which entitles you to compensation.\nor</li>\n<li>In respect of the following specific problems:</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n<strong>\n<u>Unexpected billing agreement payment</u>\n</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>\n<u>Incorrect payment</u>\n</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>\n<u>Unauthorised payment</u>\n</strong>\n</p>\n<p>It takes you longer than 8 weeks after the payment was made to tell us about the problem.\nor</p>\n<p>You agreed for us to make your payment and the details were made available to you by us or the merchant at least 4 weeks before the payment was made.</p>\n<p>It takes you longer than 13 months after the payment was made to tell us about the problem.\nor</p>\n<p>We can show that you gave us the wrong payment details.\nor</p>\n<p>We can show that the payment was sent as the payer specified when the payer asked us to make it.\nor</p>\n<p>Through no fault of ours, you did not have enough PayPal balance to complete the payment.\nor</p>\n<p>We can show our system was not working properly and you knew about the breakdown when you started the transaction.\nor</p>\n<p>A delay which you claimed caused the incorrect payment actually resulted from PayPal applying&nbsp;a <strong>hold, limitation or reserve </strong>\n<strong>under this user agreement</strong>\n</p>\n<p>It takes you longer than 13 months after the payment was made to tell us about the problem.\nor</p>\n<p>We can show that the payment was made because you did not keep your account safe either intentionally or with gross negligence (for instance, you very carelessly chose to share your PayPal ID and/or password/PIN with someone else).\nor</p>\n<p>There was <strong>another security /fraud problem</strong> and you didn\u2019t tell us about it.\nWe will not pay you compensation for any unauthorised payments made from your account before you told us about that problem.\n&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Sometimes we might spot the problem first.&nbsp.\nIf we need to notify you about the problem, we will ordinarily do so through the Secure Messaging Centre, which you need to log into your account to access.\nIf you should take action urgently, we may also use other means such as email to request action.</p>\n<p>If a payment was made from us to your funding source by way of mistake, we may correct the mistake by debiting or crediting (as the case may be) your appropriate funding source(s).</p> Complaints Reporting disputes

holds and reserves) may be based on confidential criteria that are essential to our management of risk and the protection of PayPal, our customers and/or service providers.&nbsp.\nWe may use proprietary fraud and risk modeling when assessing the risk associated with your PayPal account.&nbsp.\nIn addition, we may be restricted by regulation or a governmental authority from disclosing certain information to you about such decisions.&nbsp.\nWe have no obligation to disclose the details of our risk management or security procedures to you.</p> Our Rights Security interest <p>To

or other amounts mentioned in this section from a balance in a PayPal account held or controlled by you.</p>\n<p>If there are insufficient funds in your balance to cover your liability, we reserve the right to collect the amount you owe us by deducting the amount (or any part of it) from any payments received in or money you add to your PayPal account.&nbsp.\nOtherwise you agree to reimburse us

FEES</strong>\n<p>By agreeing to these terms, you are giving eBay permission to charge your PayPal account on a one-time, sporadic, or recurring basis to collect fees that you owe eBay, unless and until you cancel your Billing Agreement.\nYou authorize PayPal to pay from your PayPal account the full amount of fees presented by eBay.\nPayPal will not initiate payments on its own under this Billing Agreement.\nit will only pay out charges initiated by eBay.\neBay will present you with an invoice at least 10 days in advance of charging your PayPal account.</p>\n<p>PayPal will become your payment method on file with eBay for automatic payment of your eBay selling fees.\nIf you previously had another payment method on file for automatic payment of fees, PayPal will replace that method.</p>\n<p>If you change the website of registration of your eBay account (for example, you change registration from eBay.com to eBay.ca), this Billing Agreement will be cancelled.\nIf you change the currency of your eBay account, you will need to again specify PayPal as your automatic payment method for your account in the new currency.\nIf this Billing Agreement is cancelled, or if the payment of your eBay fees through PayPal cannot be completed for any reason, you remain obligated to pay eBay for all unpaid fees, and eBay may charge a payment method previously on file with eBay for payment of your selling fees, such as a credit card or checking account.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong>FUNDING SOURCE USE</strong>\n<p>When eBay charges your PayPal account, PayPal will always attempt to withdraw funds from your PayPal balance first.\nIf funds in your balance are insufficient, PayPal will look for and attempt to charge a Preferred Funding Source that you have set up for this Billing Agreement.\nIf the Preferred Funding Source fails (for example, a credit card expires), then PayPal will use other available funding sources within your PayPal account.\nYou will have the ability to disable funding sources for use with this Billing Agreement, with the exception that if you have one or more credit or debit cards linked to your PayPal account, then at least one of those cards must be enabled for billing.</p>\n<p>You will be able to select or deselect a Preferred Funding Source, and to enable or disable other funding sources, both within the enrollment flow, and at any time through the Direct Payments link under the Account Profile tab when you log in to the PayPal website.</p>\n</li>\n</ol> ", "created_at": "2019-05-12T22:28:10.902Z", "updated_at":

those amounts automatically transferred to your linked US bank account or Visa credit card.\nAll payments that you receive are subject to a 30-day hold period.\nPlease read these terms and conditions to understand PayPal\u2019s requirements for receiving payments.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p> 1.\nEligibility: <ol>\n<li>In order to receive payments into your PayPal account, you must link your US bank account or Visa credit card to your PayPal account and complete PayPal\u2019s credit card and/or bank account verification process.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>&nbsp;</p> 2.\nAutomatic Transfer: <ol>\n<li>On a regular basis, PayPal will automatically transfer the amounts from your available PayPal Balance to your US bank account or Visa credit card.</li>\n<li>The automatic transfer will occur within the first 3 days of each month, quarter, or applicable period in the country in which you reside.</li>\n<li>There is no fee for automatic transfers to your US bank account or Visa credit card.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>&nbsp;</p> 3.\nManual Transfer and Fee: <ol>\n<li>If you do not want to wait for the automatic transfer, you may manually transfer the amounts in your available PayPal balance to

free.</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>&nbsp;</p> 4.\nPayment Hold Period: <ol>\n<li>All payments that you receive will be subject to an initial 30 day hold period and will be placed in a pending balance.\nThis means that you will not have access to your funds for at least 30 days.</li>\n<li>After the initial 30 day hold period, your funds will be released to your available balance unless PayPal is holding the amounts for another reason as specified in the PayPal User Agreement, or other agreement that you have entered into with PayPal.</li>\n<li>PayPal, in its sole discretion, may determine that you are no longer subject to an initial 30 day hold period.\nIn such an event, payments you receive into your PayPal account will appear in your available balance soon after you receive the payment.\nPayPal will base its decision to remove the 30 day hold period on a number of factors including but not limited to the following: the length of time you have been a PayPal customer, the type of goods or services that you sell, and the number of customer complaints that you receive.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>&nbsp;</p> 5.\nWithdrawal Limits: <ol>\n<li>Automatic transfers to your Visa credit

to your Visa credit card (total of automatic and manual transfers) is $10,000 USD (or equivalent).</li>\n</ol>\n<p>&nbsp;</p> 6.\nFinancial Instruments (linked US bank account or Visa credit card): <ol>\n<li>If you have more than one financial instrument linked to your PayPal account, PayPal will use the first financial instrument that you linked to your PayPal account for automatic transfers.\n<ol>\n<li>This means that if you link a Visa credit card to your PayPal account one day, and then link a second Visa credit card to your account the next day, PayPal will use the first Visa credit card for the automatic transfer.</li>\n<li>You may change this by going to the \u201cProfile\u201d page, selecting \u201cManage Automatic Transfer\u201d, and following the instructions to select your preferred financial instrument for automatic transfers.</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li>If you remove your US bank account and/or Visa credit card, PayPal will request that you add a new financial instrument to your PayPal account.\nIf you do not do so, you will lose the ability to receive payments.</li>\n<li>If PayPal is unable to transfer your balance to your US bank account and/or Visa credit card for any reason, then PayPal will give you a limited amount of time to add a new financial instrument to your PayPal account.\nIf you do not do so, you will lose the ability to receive payments.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>&nbsp;</p> 7.\nRestriction on Sending Payments: <ol>\n<li>You may use your credit card to send payments.\nYou may not use your PayPal balance or US bank account to send payments.\nAll amounts in your available PayPal balance must be withdrawn from your PayPal account through automatic and/or manual transfer.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>&nbsp;</p> 8.\nTransaction Fees for

referred to as \u201cMerchant\u201d and may be referred to herein as \u201cyou\u201d and/or \u201cyour\u201d.\nThis CEA constitutes your separate legally binding contract for credit and debit card processing for PayPal transactions between you and the Acquirer (as defined below).</p>\n<p>For the purposes of this CEA, \"Acquirer\" shall mean (a) Worldpay (UK) Limited if Merchant is based in

Acquirer may terminate its provision of credit and debit card processing services and require PayPal to enforce any of the provisions of Merchant\u2019s agreement(s) with PayPal (\"PayPal Agreement\"), agreed by and between Merchant and PayPal.</p>\n<p>Merchant agrees to the terms and conditions of this CEA.\nMerchant further agrees that this CEA forms a legally binding contract between Merchant and Acquirer.\nPayPal is not a party to this contract and acts only as Acquirer\u2019s agent in connection with it.\nIf we propose to change this CEA in a substantial manner, PayPal will provide you on our behalf with at least 30 days' (or such minimum period as is required by law) prior notice of such a change.\nAfter the notice period elapses, you will be deemed to have agreed

through PayPal, they have the option of paying you through a funding source supported by PayPal including a card.\nIn most instances, you will not know the funding source that your customer

service dispute of the Merchant relating to any services provided to the Merchant should be notified to and brought against PayPal in the first instance.</li>\n<li>Subject to the terms of this CEA and the PayPal Agreement, Acquirer will initiate a payment to the designated account (as made known to Acquirer by PayPal) of an amount equal to the value of card transactions processed by Acquirer for the Merchant under this CEA (less deductions for refunds, fines, assessments, chargebacks, chargeback costs, fees or other Merchant liabilities (whether actual or anticipated) under this CEA or the PayPal Agreement).\n&nbsp;Any obligation of Acquirer to remit funds under this CEA is subject to any rights of Acquirer under its agreement with PayPal.</li>\n<li>Merchant agrees that any payment made

obligations under the Association rules) arising from or relating to the payment of funds by Acquirer into an account in the name of PayPal in accordance with the terms of this CEA.</li>\n<li>Throughout the term of this CEA and after its termination for any reason, Acquirer shall be entitled to defer (for such period as it shall in its reasonable discretion consider appropriate) the date upon which the payment of funds in respect of card transactions would (but for this clause) be due in order to protect its position with respect to actual or anticipated chargebacks, fines, assessments, refunds, chargeback costs, fees, fraud, illegal activity or any other liability of Merchant or relating to any card transactions or under this CEA or the PPA, whether actual or anticipated.&nbsp.\nAmounts so deferred may be set-off against any actual chargebacks, fines, assessments, refunds, chargeback costs, fees or any other liability of

without cost or penalty.\nThis user agreement will continue to apply to your previous use of our services.</p> About our main business <p>PayPal is a payment services provider and acts as such by creating, hosting, maintaining and providing our PayPal services to you via the internet.\nOur services allow you to send payments to anyone with a PayPal account, and, where available, to receive payments.\nOur service availability varies by country/region.\nYou can see what services are available in your country/region by logging into your PayPal account.</p>\n<p>The PayPal services are offered by PayPal Pte.\nLtd.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Consumer Advisory \u2014 PayPal Pte.\nLtd., the holder of the PayPal stored value facility, does not require the approval of the Monetary Authority of Singapore.\nConsumers (users) are advised to read the terms and conditions carefully.</strong>\n</p>\n<p>This user agreement is not a solicitation of the PayPal services and PayPal is not targeting any country/region or market through this user agreement.</p> Opening an Account <p>We offer two types of accounts: personal accounts and business accounts.</p>\n<p>All PayPal accounts let you do things like:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Send and receive payments.</li>\n<li>Buy things online, using mobile devices or in stores.</li>\n<li>Make payments using your credit card, debit card, bank account, PayPal balance, eCheque or other payment methods.</li>\n<li>Accept credit card, debit card, bank account, PayPal balance, eCheque or other payment methods from others.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>You are responsible for maintaining adequate security and control of any and all IDs, passwords, personal identification numbers, or any other codes that you use to access your PayPal account and the PayPal services.</p>\n<p>In order to open and maintain a PayPal account, you must list your correct country/region of residence and provide us with correct and updated account information, including but not limited to personal information, financial information, or other information related to you or your business.</p>\n<p>You must keep your mailing address, email address and other contact information current in your PayPal account profile.</p> Personal accounts <p>If you primarily need to make purchases and send payments to family and friends, a personal account is probably right for you.\nWith a personal account you can do things like:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Buy goods and services.</li>\n<li>Send and request payments from friends and family.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>You can also use a personal account to receive payments for the sale of goods and services, but if you plan to use your PayPal account primarily to sell things, you should consider a business account.\nYou can convert your PayPal account from a personal account to a business account should circumstances change.</p> Business accounts <p>We recommend business accounts for people and organizations that primarily use PayPal to sell goods or services, even if your business is not incorporated.\nWith a business account, you can do things like:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Use a company or business name as the name on your PayPal account.</li>\n<li>Allow employees access to some of the features of your PayPal account.</li>\n<li>Sign up for PayPal products that meet your business needs.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Business accounts may be subject to fees that differ from the fees applicable to personal accounts.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>By opening up a business account or converting a personal account to a business account, you certify to us that you are using it primarily for a business or commercial purpose.\nYou also consent to PayPal obtaining your personal and/or business credit report from a credit reporting agency at account opening, when you request certain new products and whenever we reasonably believe there may be an increased level of risk associated with your business account.</strong>\n</p> Commercial Entity Agreement <p>If the activity through any type of PayPal account you hold reaches certain thresholds or involves certain business segments or activities, you are required by the card networks to agree to a Commercial Entity Agreement to allow you to continue accepting Visa and MasterCard payments.\nIn this case, these Commercial Entity Agreements will apply to any payment processed by PayPal on your behalf and will form part of this user agreement.</p> Third Party permissions <p>You must be the beneficial owner of your PayPal account, and conduct business only on behalf of yourself.</p>\n<p>You may expressly grant, remove and manage permissions for some third parties to take certain actions on your behalf.\nIn some cases, you can do this when logged into your PayPal account \u2013 in other cases, you can do this directly with the third party.\nYou acknowledge that if you grant permission for a third party to take actions on your behalf, we may disclose certain information about your PayPal account to this third party.</p>\n<p>You may permit third party service providers licensed by applicable law to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>provide account information services to access information about your account on your behalf;</li>\n<li>confirm whether an amount necessary for the execution of a card-based payment transaction is available on your account.\nor</li>\n<li>provide payment initiation services to initiate payments from your account on your behalf.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Granting permission to any third party to access your PayPal account in any way does not relieve you of any of your responsibilities under this user agreement.\nYou are liable to us for the actions that you authorize the third parties to carry out.\nYou will not hold us responsible for, and you will indemnify us from, any liability arising from the actions or inactions of such third parties in connection with the permissions you granted, subject to your mandatory legal rights.</p> Closing Your PayPal Account <p>You may close your account and terminate your relationship with us at any time without cost or penalty, but you will remain liable for all obligations related to your PayPal account even after the PayPal account is closed.\nWhen you close your PayPal account, we will cancel any scheduled or incomplete transactions.\nYou must withdraw or transfer any PayPal balance from your PayPal account before closing it.\nYou cannot withdraw or transfer digital gift certificates/cards that are purchased through PayPal Digital Gifts and linked to your PayPal account as payment methods.\nHowever, even without your PayPal account, you can still use the codes you received by email when you purchased the gift certificates/cards to make purchases.\n</p>\n<p>In certain cases, you may not close your PayPal account, including:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>To evade an investigation.</li>\n<li>If you have a pending transaction or an open dispute or claim.</li>\n<li>If your PayPal account has a negative balance.</li>\n<li>If your PayPal account is subject to a hold, limitation or reserve.</li>\n</ul> Link or Unlink a Payment Method <p>You can link or unlink a credit card, debit card or a bank account to your PayPal account as a payment method.\nPlease keep your payment method information current (i.e.\ncredit card number and expiration date).\nIf this information changes, we may update it using information and third party sources available to us without any action on your part.\nIf you do not want us to update your card information, you may remove your payment method from your PayPal account.\nIf we update your payment method, we will keep any preference setting attached to such payment method.\nYou may choose to confirm your card, so that we can verify that the card is valid and that you are the card owner.</p> Holding a PayPal Balance <p>Any PayPal balance you hold represents an unsecured claim against PayPal.\nPayPal combines your balance with the balances of other users and invests those funds in liquid investments.\nThese pooled amounts are held separate from PayPal's corporate funds, and PayPal will neither use these funds for its operating expenses or any other corporate purposes nor will it voluntarily make these funds available to its creditors in the event of bankruptcy.\nYou will not receive interest or other earnings on the amounts in your balance.\nYou agree PayPal shall own the interest or other earnings on these investments.\nYou agree to assign any rights to any interest derived from your funds to PayPal.</p> Adding or Withdrawing Funds Adding funds to your balance <p>You may use the payment methods linked to your PayPal account to fund transactions you make using your PayPal account.\nYou don't need a PayPal balance to buy something or send payments.\nYou can add funds your PayPal account from the bank account that's linked to your PayPal account by requesting an electronic transfer to your PayPal account.\nThe amount transferred will be held as a balance in your PayPal account.\nCredit cards cannot be used to add funds to your PayPal balance.</p> Withdrawing funds from your balance <p>If you have a PayPal balance, log into your PayPal account to see which of these withdrawal options are available in your country/region:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>transferring it to a bank account linked to your PayPal account.\nor</li>\n<li>transferring it to your debit or credit card, where available.\nor</li>\n<li>requesting a physical cheque through the mail, where available.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Depending on the country/region in which your account is registered, you may be able to withdraw your funds through a third party service provider.\nPlease see terms of such third party for information regarding currency conversions.</p>\n<p>To protect us and our users from loss, we may delay a withdrawal in certain situations, including if we need to confirm that you have authorized the withdrawal or if other payments to your PayPal account have been subject to a reversal (for example, as a result of a chargeback, bank reversal or dispute by a buyer).\nIf we place a limitation on your PayPal account, a payment is subject to a hold, or your account or an associated account has a negative balance in any currency while a withdrawal from your PayPal account is pending, you will have to reinitiate the withdrawal once the limitation or hold has been lifted, or the negative balance is fully paid off.</p>\n<p>We may set limits on your withdrawals, and you can view any withdrawal limit by logging into your PayPal account.\nCompleting the following steps can help us verify your PayPal account, which may allow us to remove any withdrawal cap:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Verifying your bank account.\nand</li>\n<li>Linking and confirming your credit card or debit card information.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>We may charge a fee to make a transfer to your bank account.\nIf your debit card is eligible to receive withdrawals from your PayPal account, you will be provided the option to use it when you transfer funds out of your PayPal balance, subject to the fees applicable to such transfers that can be found on the Fees for Transferring Balance (for personal accounts) page and the Fees for Transferring Balance (for business accounts) page.\nThe applicable fees will be disclosed to you in advance each time you initiate such a withdrawal.</p>\n<p>Generally, we will send physical cheques through the mail only to confirmed addresses, unless we have verified your PayPal account.\nWe will not send cheques to post office boxes.\nIf you would like us to send a cheque to an address that does not meet these criteria, you must contact customer service and provide the documentation that we request to verify your association with the address.\nIf you fail to cash a cheque within 180 Days of the date of issuance, we will return the funds to your balance (minus a fee).</p> Managing Your Balance in Multiple Currencies Holding multiple currencies <p>Your PayPal balance may be held in any of the currencies supported by PayPal, and you may hold a balance in more than one of these currencies at the same time.</p>\n<p>If you hold a balance in your PayPal account:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>We may allow you to convert the balance into another currency.\nIf you convert the balance in your account, PayPal's transaction exchange rate (including our currency conversion fee) will be used.\nWe may, at our discretion, impose limits on the amount of your balance that you can convert or the number of conversions you can perform.</li>\n<li>You may only withdraw the balance in the opening currency of your account or such other currency that PayPal supports for withdrawal in your registered country/region.\nIn order to withdraw the balance in your account which is held in another currency you will have to convert the currency to the opening currency of your account, or it will be converted for you at the time of your withdrawal.\nPayPal's transaction exchange rate, including our currency conversion fee, will be used.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>To receive funds in a currency that your account is not currently configured to accept, it may be necessary to create a balance in your PayPal account in that currency or convert the balance into another currency.\nCertain currencies can only be received by converting the balance into another currency that PayPal allows you to hold.\nIf the balance is converted, PayPal's transaction exchange rate (including our currency conversion fee) will be used.</p>\n<p>You are responsible for all risks associated with maintaining multiple currencies in your PayPal account.\nYou may not manage or convert currencies for speculative trading purposes, conversion arbitrage, conversion options, or any other activity that PayPal determines is primarily for the purpose of gaining or making money based on currency conversion rates.\nPayPal may hold, cancel, or reverse any transaction we determine to violate this policy.</p> How we convert currency <p>If PayPal converts currency, it will be completed at the transaction exchange rate we set for the relevant currency exchange.\nThe transaction exchange rate is adjusted regularly and includes a currency conversion fee applied and retained by us on a base exchange rate to form the rate applicable to your conversion.\nThe base exchange rate is based on rates within the wholesale currency markets on the conversion day or the prior Business Day.\nor, if required by law or regulation, set at the relevant government reference rate(s).</p>\n<p>For some uses of your PayPal accounts, PayPal may determine currency conversion is necessary.\nThe currency conversion fee applicable can be found on our fees page under the heading Currency conversion fees.</p>Currency conversion choices <p>When your payment is funded by a debit or credit card and involves a currency conversion by PayPal, you consent to and authorize us to convert the currency in place of your debit or credit card issuer.\nYou may have the right to have your card issuer perform the currency conversion, if applicable for that card issuer and network.\nThis currency preference selection may be presented to you in various forms, including a choice of which currency is used for the transaction, whether PayPal or your card issuer performs the conversion, or which conversion rate is used for the transaction, among others.\nIf your card issuer converts the currency, your card issuer will determine the currency conversion rate and the fees they may charge.</p>\n<p>PayPal will always perform the conversion for transactions where you use your existing PayPal balance or your linked bank account is the payment method.</p> Account Statements Account Statements <p>You have the right to receive an account statement showing your PayPal account activity.\nYou may view your PayPal account statement by logging into your PayPal account.</p> PAYPAL USER AGREEMENT\nSending payments and buying Sending payments to or Receiving payments from a Friend or Family Member Sending payments <p>In some countries/regions, you can send funds to a friend or family member from your PayPal account using the send payments feature in your PayPal account (sometimes called personal payments or peer-to-peer/P2P payments).\n</p>\n<p>Visit our Available Services by Country/Region of Residence list to see which services are available in your country/region of residence or log into your PayPal account.</p>\n<p>You can send funds to a friend or family member even if they don't have a PayPal account at the time you send them funds, using their email address or mobile number, in any currency that PayPal supports, and you can choose which payment method you want to use.\nIf the person to whom you are sending funds does not have a PayPal account, they can claim it by opening a PayPal account.\nIf they don't claim it, it will be refunded to you.\nReceiving funds from a friend or family member is described under <strong>Receiving Funds</strong>.</p>\n<p>We may, at our discretion, impose limits on the amount of funds you can send, including funds you send for purchases.\nYou can view any sending limit by logging in to your PayPal account.\nWe may increase your sending limits if you complete the same steps to verify your information as is required for the removal of withdrawal limits.</p>\n<p>When you send funds to a friend or family member, one of three things may happen: they may accept, decline or fail to claim the funds.\nIf they either decline to accept the funds or don't claim them within 30 days of the date they are sent, the funds (including any fees you were charged) will be refunded to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The original payment method you used for the transaction, if you used a credit card, debit card or PayPal Credit as the payment method, or</li>\n<li>Your PayPal balance, if you used your PayPal balance as the payment method or a bank account as the payment method and we cannot refund it to your bank account.</li>\n</ul> Receiving payments <p>If a friend or family member sends funds to you, the funds will appear in your PayPal balance.\nTo receive funds in a currency your account is not currently configured to accept, it may be necessary to create a balance in that currency or convert the funds into another currency.\nCertain currencies can only be received by converting the balance into another currency that PayPal allows you to hold.\nIf the balance is converted, PayPal's transaction exchange rate (including our currency conversion fee) will be used.</p> Fees for Sending payments to Friends and Family <p>The fees applicable to sending funds can be found in our Sending funds table and will be disclosed to you in advance each time you initiate a transaction to send funds to a friend or family member.\nIf you convert your PayPal balance from one currency to another, PayPal's transaction exchange rate (including our currency conversion fee) will be used.</p>\n<p>If you send funds to a friend or family member from a third party (non-PayPal) website or by using a third party's product or service, then the third party will determine if the sender or recipient pays the fee.\nThis will be disclosed to you by the third party before the payment is initiated.</p> Buying Something From, or Returning Something to, a Seller Who Accepts PayPal How to buy something <p>You can buy something from a seller who accepts PayPal in any currency that the seller accepts, and that PayPal supports, using the funds in your PayPal balance, or using any payment method linked to your PayPal account.\nThis includes, for example:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Buying something at an online retailer's website and selecting PayPal as your payment method at checkout.</li>\n<li>Sending a payment to a seller for good or services.</li>\n<li>Using your PayPal account to buy something at a seller's physical store.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If the seller you are buying from sells goods or services and that seller does not already have a PayPal account, they can claim your payment by opening a PayPal account.\nIf they don't open a PayPal account within 30 days, your purchase will be refunded.</p>\n<p>In order to manage risk, PayPal may limit the payment methods available for a transaction when you buy something.\nIn addition, payment methods may be limited for certain sellers or if you make a PayPal payment through certain third-party websites or applications, for example:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>American Express may not be available as a payment method for certain merchants, such as branded airlines and certain travel merchants;</li>\n<li>Some credit cards may not be available as a payment method for certain merchants, such as those in the gambling industry.\nand</li>\n<li>Credit cards cannot be used to send personal payments or to top up your PayPal balance</li>\n</ul>\n<p>When you authorize a payment to a seller who accepts PayPal, some sellers may take up to 30 days to complete the transaction.\nIn these instances, your payment may appear as a pending order in your PayPal account.\nIn that case, your authorization of the payment will remain valid until the seller completes the transaction (but no longer than 30 days).\nIf you used a debit or credit card as the payment method, your debit or credit card issuer also may show a pending authorization for a period of time until they release the hold or receive a completed transaction.</p>\n<p>If your payment requires a currency conversion by us, the transaction exchange rate will be determined and applied as described in the How we convert currency section and will be determined at the time the payment is processed.</p>\nFees <p>When you buy something from a seller who accepts PayPal, you don't pay a fee to PayPal.\nIf PayPal performs a currency conversion for your purchase, PayPal's transaction exchange rate (including our currency conversion fee) will be used.</p>\n<p>Your credit card or debit card issuer may also charge you a separate fee for transactions.</p> Payment review <p>When PayPal identifies a potentially high-risk transaction, we review the transaction more closely before allowing it to proceed.\nWhen this happens, PayPal will place a hold on the transaction and notify the seller to delay shipping of the item.\nAs a buyer, this may delay your receipt of the item you purchased.\nIf we clear the transaction, we will notify the seller and direct them to ship the item.\nIf we don't clear the transaction, we will cancel it and return the funds to you, unless we are legally required to take other action.</p>\nAutomatic payments <p>You can agree with a seller who accepts PayPal to use PayPal as the payment method for future purchases with that seller.\nThis agreement is between you and the seller and allows the seller to take funds from your PayPal account with your authorization on a one-time, regular or sporadic basis.\nExamples of automatic payments that can be arranged by you either with a seller or with PayPal include those that PayPal calls a \"billing agreement,\" \"subscription,\" \"recurring payment,\" \"reference transaction,\" \"preauthorized debit or PAD\", \"preauthorized transfer\" or \"preapproved payment.\"</p>\n<p>You may cancel an automatic payment up to 3 Business Days before the date of the next scheduled payment from your account settings or by contacting us through the PayPal Help Centre.\nOnce an automatic payment is canceled, all future automatic payments under your agreement with that seller will be stopped.\nIf you cancel an automatic payment, you may still owe the seller funds for the purchase or have additional obligations to the seller for any goods or services that you receive but have not paid for and you may be required to pay the seller through alternative means.</p>\n<p>If you have given advance authorization, either to a seller or to PayPal, that permits a seller to take or receive payments from your PayPal account on a regularly recurring basis (for example, every month or otherwise on a routine billing cycle), and if such payments will vary in amount, you have the right to advance notice of the amount and date of the transfer from the seller at least 10 days before the transfer is made.\nIf the seller provides the option, you may choose to receive this advance notice only when the amount of your automatic payment will fall outside a range established between you and the seller.</p>\n<p>If you have authorized an automatic payment and PayPal performs a currency conversion for an automatic payment transaction, PayPal will use the transaction exchange rate (including PayPal's currency conversion fee) in effect at the time the automatic payment transaction is processed.</p>\n<p>\n</p> Refunds <p>When you buy something from a seller online using PayPal and the transaction is ultimately refunded, the payment will typically be refunded to the original payment method you used for the transaction if you used a credit card, debit card or PayPal balance.\nIf you used a bank account as the payment method for the transaction, we will refund the payment to your bank account, or to your PayPal balance if we cannot refund it to your bank account.\nFor purchases you make in a seller's store location that you paid for using your PayPal account and the transaction is ultimately refunded, the payment will be refunded to your PayPal balance.</p>\n<p>If PayPal performed a currency conversion for your transaction and a refund is issued:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>within 1 day of the date of the original payment, the transaction exchange rate (including our currency conversion fee) used at the time of the original payment will apply.</li>\n<li>beyond 1 day of the date of the original payment, PayPal's transaction exchange rate (including our currency conversion fee) on the date of the refund will apply.\nThe transaction exchange rate may be applied immediately and without notice to you.\nThis means that you may not receive the full amount of your original payment due to the fees above and fluctuations in currency conversion rates.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Payments will be refunded in the currency you paid, or if we are unable to refund in the currency you paid, in your primary holding currency.</p> Payment Method Used for My Transaction Selecting a preferred payment method <p>In certain countries, you can choose any of the payment methods in your PayPal account as your preferred payment method.\nYou can select a preferred payment method in your account preferences.\nThere may be times when your preferred payment method cannot be used, for example, if you select a credit card that is expired.</p>\n<p>You can set separate preferred payment methods for online transactions, in-store transactions and automatic payments with a seller.</p>\n<p>If you have chosen a preferred payment method, it will be shown as the primary method of payment.</p>\n<p>The availability of certain payment methods may be limited based on that particular seller or the third party website you are using to complete the transaction.\n</p>\n<p>If you have not selected a preferred payment method, or your preferred payment method is unavailable, we will show you available payment methods, including the payment method you used most often or most recently, at the time of transaction.\nYou can also click on the \"Manage\" link to see all of your available payment methods, or add a new one, and select a payment method during the transaction.</p> Backup payment method <p>Certain one-time online transactions may require that a backup funding method be used in the event that your selected or preferred payment method is unavailable.\nIn those instances, the backup funding method may be displayed to you on your transaction review page, before you complete the transaction.\nNote that this only applies for one-time, online transactions, and not for automatic payments.\nIf PayPal determines currency conversion is necessary for a transaction that also requires a backup payment method, you may not be able to separately choose whether PayPal or your card issuer performs the currency conversion on your backup payment method.</p> Sending payments to friends and family <p>When you send payments to friends and family using your PayPal balance (if available) or your bank account, we waive all fees, so we always show you these payment options first, even if you have a set preferred payment method for your online purchases.\nRemember, you always have the choice to select any payment method in your PayPal account by clicking the \"Change\" link on the Send Payments page.\nIf you select a payment method with a fee, we will always show you the fee before you send the payment.</p>\nAutomatic payments <p>Some sellers allow you to store PayPal as the way to pay when making purchases on their site, so you can check out faster.\nOften, this entails creating an agreement with the seller that permits them to request that we charge your PayPal account each time you make a purchase.\n</p>\n<p>You can select a payment method for future purchases with a particular seller either at the time of creating the agreement or in your account settings.\nFor example, you can instruct your monthly movie subscription service to always charge your credit card for the monthly cost.</p>\n<p>If your chosen payment method is unavailable (e.g.\ncredit card expired), a particular agreement with a seller does not provide for the ability to specify a payment method, or if you have not designated a payment method for future transactions with a seller, the payment method used will be in the following order, as applicable: 1.\nbalance.\n2.\nbank account (instant transfer).\n3.\nPayPal co-branded debit card.\n4.\nPayPal co-branded credit card.\n5.\ndebit card.\n6.\ncredit card.\nand 7.\neCheque.</p>\n<p>You can cancel any agreement in your account settings.</p>\nBank account transfers <p>When you use your bank account as a payment method, you are allowing PayPal to initiate a transfer from your bank account to the recipient.\nFor these transactions, PayPal will make electronic transfers from your bank account in the amount you specify.\nYou authorize PayPal to try this transfer again if the initial transfer is rejected by your bank for any reason.</p> eCheque <p>eCheque is a payment method where you use your bank account as your payment method, and the payment is not received by the recipient until the transaction is processed from the bank.\nThis process usually takes 3-5 Business Days, but this amount of time will increase if the payment is sent from a bank account located outside of your country/region.</p>\n<p>If eCheque is your preferred payment method, it will be used to fund your PayPal payment, even if you have a balance.</p> PayPal\u2019s Buyer Protection Program PayPal Buyer Protection <p>When you buy something from a seller who accepts PayPal, you may be eligible for a refund under PayPal's Buyer Protection program.\nWhen applicable, PayPal's Buyer Protection program entitles you to reimbursement for the full purchase price of the item plus the original shipping costs you paid, if any.\nPayPal determines, in its sole discretion, whether your claim qualifies for the Buyer Protection program.\nPayPal's original determination is considered final, but you may be able to file an appeal of the decision with PayPal if you have new or compelling information not available at the time of the original determination or you believe there was an error in the decision-making process.\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>IMPORTANT:</strong> You may be required to return the item to the seller or other party we specify as part of the settlement of your claim.\nPayPal's Buyer Protection program does not entitle you to reimbursement for the return shipping costs that you may incur.</p>\n<p>PayPal's Buyer Protection program may apply when you encounter these specific problems with a transaction:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>You didn't receive your item from a seller (referred to as an \"Item Not Received\" claim), or</li>\n<li>You received an item, but the item isn't what you ordered (referred to as a \"Significantly Not as Described\" claim).</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If you believe that a transaction made through your PayPal account was not authorized by you, this type of claim is different from the Buyer Protection program, and is described below under Liability for Unauthorized Transactions.</p>\nItem Not Received claims <p>Your claim <em>will not</em> qualify for a refund under PayPal's Buyer Protection program for an Item Not Received claim if:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>You collect the item in person, or arrange for it to be collected on your behalf, including if you use PayPal in a seller's store location, or</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>The seller has provided proof of shipment or proof of delivery.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If the seller presents evidence that they delivered the goods to your address, PayPal may find in favor of the seller for an Item Not Received claim even if you claim you did not receive the goods.</p> Significantly Not As Described claims <p>An item may be considered Significantly Not as Described if:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The item is materially different from the seller's description of it.</li>\n<li>You received a completely different item.</li>\n<li>The condition of the item was misrepresented.\nFor example, the item was described as \"new\" but the item was used.</li>\n<li>The item was advertised as authentic but is not authentic (i.e.\nit is counterfeit).</li>\n<li>The item is missing major parts or features and those facts were not disclosed in the description of the item when you bought it.</li>\n<li>You purchased a certain number of items but didn't receive them all.</li>\n<li>The item was materially damaged during shipment.</li>\n<li>The item is unusable in its received state and was not disclosed as such.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>An item may not be considered Significantly Not as Described if:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The item is materially similar to the seller's description of it.</li>\n<li>The defect in the item was correctly described by the seller in its description of the item.</li>\n<li>The item was properly described but you didn't want it after you received it.</li>\n<li>The item was properly described but did not meet your expectations.</li>\n<li>The item has minor scratches and was described as \"used.\"</li>\n</ul>\nIneligible items and transactions under PayPal's Buyer Protection program <p>Payments for the following are not eligible for reimbursement under PayPal Buyer Protection:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Real estate, including residential property.</li>\n<li>Financial products or investments of any kind.</li>\n<li>Businesses (when you buy or invest in all or part of a business).</li>\n<li>Vehicles, including, but not limited to, motor vehicles, motorcycles, recreational vehicles, aircraft and boats.</li>\n<li>Significantly Not as Described claims for wholly or partly custom-made items or items picked up in person.</li>\n<li>Donations including payments on crowdfunding platforms.</li>\n<li>Items prohibited by the PayPal Acceptable Use Policy.</li>\n<li>For Item Not Received claims, items which you collect in person or arrange to be collected on your behalf, including items bought in a seller's store location.</li>\n<li>Industrial machinery used in manufacturing.</li>\n<li>Anything purchased from, or an amount paid to, a government agency.</li>\n<li>Stored value items such as gift cards and pre-paid cards.</li>\n<li>Gambling, gaming and/or any other activity with an entry fee and a prize.</li>\n<li>Personal payments.\n</li>\n<li>Payments sent using PayPal to any bill payment service.</li>\n<li>Payments made using PayPal Payouts and Mass Pay or guest checkout transactions (i.e.\nnot sent using your PayPal account).</li>\n<li>Send payment transactions where the sender pays the PayPal transaction fee.</li>\n<li>Items intended for resale, including single item transactions or transactions that include multiple items.</li>\n</ul>\nTransaction eligibility for PayPal's Buyer Protection program <p>To be eligible for PayPal Buyer Protection you must meet all of the following requirements:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Have a PayPal account in good standing.</li>\n<li>Pay for the eligible item from your PayPal account.</li>\n<li>Attempt to contact the seller to resolve your issue directly before filing a claim under PayPal\u2019s Purchase Protection through the Resolution Center.</li>\n<li>Respond to PayPal's request for documentation and other information within the time requested.\n</li>\n<li>Open a dispute in the Resolution Centre within 180 days of the date you sent the payment, and follow our online dispute resolution process.</li>\n<li>Not have received a recovery or agreed to an alternative resolution related to your purchase from another source.</li>\n</ul>\nOur online dispute resolution process <p>If you're unable to resolve a transaction related issue directly with a seller, you must follow our online dispute resolution process through the Resolution Centre to pursue a claim under our Buyer Protection program.\nYou may also file a claim (Step 2 below) by calling us and speaking to an agent.\nThe steps you must follow are described below, and if you do not follow these steps your claim may be denied:</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Step 1:</strong>\n<strong>Open a dispute</strong> within 180 days of the date you made the payment.\nThis might allow you to start a direct conversation with the seller regarding your issue with the transaction that may help resolve the dispute.\nIf you are unable to resolve the dispute directly with the seller, proceed to Step 2.\nWe will place a hold on all funds related to the transaction in the seller's PayPal account until the dispute is resolved or closed.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Step 2:</strong>\n<strong>Escalate the dispute to a claim</strong> for reimbursement within 20 days after opening the dispute, if you and the seller are unable to come to an agreement, or we will automatically close the dispute.\nYou can escalate the dispute to a claim for reimbursement through the Resolution Centre.\nThe seller or PayPal may also escalate the dispute to a claim at this point.\nPayPal may ask you to wait at least 7 days from the transaction date to escalate the dispute.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Step 3:</strong>\n<strong>Respond to PayPal's requests for documentation or other information</strong>, after you, the seller or PayPal escalates your dispute to a claim for reimbursement.\nPayPal may require you to provide receipts, third party evaluations, police reports or other documents that PayPal specifies.\nYou must respond to these requests in a timely manner as requested in our correspondence with you.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Step 4:</strong>\n<strong>Comply with PayPal's shipping requests in a timely manner</strong>, if you're filing a Significantly Not as Described claim.\nPayPal may require you, at your expense, to ship the item back to the seller, to PayPal or to a third party (which will be specified by PayPal) and to provide proof of delivery.</p>\nProof of delivery means: <p>For transactions that total less than $750 USD (or the equivalent currency threshold in the table below), confirmation that can be viewed online and includes the delivery address showing at least city/ or postal code, delivery date, and the identity of the shipping company you used.</p>\n<p>For transactions that total $750 USD (or the equivalent currency threshold in the table below) or more, you must provide signature confirmation of delivery (except for buyers having a PayPal account registered: in Albania, Andorra, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, Iceland, Israel, or Ukraine to whom such requirement won't apply).\nIf the transaction is in a currency not listed in the table, then signature confirmation is required when the payment exceeds the equivalent of $750 USD at the PayPal exchange rate that applies at the time the transaction is processed.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Signature</strong>\n<strong>confirmation currency thresholds</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Currency</p>\n<p>Transaction value</p>\n<p>Currency</p>\n<p>Transaction value</p>\n<p>Australian Dollar:</p>\n<p>850 AUD</p>\n<p>New Zealand Dollar:</p>\n<p>950

will make a final decision</strong> (including automatically closing any dispute or claim), in its sole discretion, based on the coverage and eligibility requirements set forth above, any additional information provided during the online dispute resolution process or any other information PayPal deems relevant and appropriate under the circumstances.</p>\n<p>Note that when you are making Digital Goods Micropayments Purchases, there are special rules that apply and that include pre-determined thresholds where we may, at our discretion, reverse the transaction without requiring you to take further action.\nWe may limit the number of automatic reversals that you benefit from, but, even if that is the case, you will still be able to follow PayPal's standard dispute resolution processes described above.</p>\n<p>In the event that PayPal makes a final decision in favour of the buyer or seller, each party must comply with PayPal's decision.</p>\n<p>If PayPal finds in favour of a buyer, PayPal will reimburse the buyer for the full purchase price of the item and original shipping costs.</p>\n<p>In a seller loses a claim, the seller will not receive a refund on the PayPal fees associated with the transaction.</p>\n<p>If a seller loses a Significantly Not as Described claim due to the item sold being counterfeit, the seller will be required to provide a full refund to the buyer and you will not receive the item back.</p>\nDispute with us or your card issuer <p>If you used a credit card or debit card as the payment method for a transaction through your PayPal account and you are dissatisfied with the transaction, you may be entitled to dispute the transaction with your card issuer.\nApplicable card chargeback rights may be broader than those available to you under PayPal's Buyer Protection program.\nFor example, if you dispute a transaction with your card issuer, you may be able to recover amounts you paid for unsatisfactory items even if they don't qualify for protection under a Significantly Not as Described claim with us.</p>\n<p>You must choose whether to pursue a dispute with PayPal under our Buyer Protection program, or to pursue the dispute with your card issuer.\nYou can't do both at the same time or seek a double recovery.\nIf you pursue a dispute/claim with us and you also pursue a dispute for the same transaction with your card issuer, we'll close your dispute/claim with us.\nThis won't affect the dispute process with your card issuer.\nIn addition, if you pursue a dispute with your card issuer, you cannot pursue a dispute/claim with us later.</p>\n<p>If you choose to dispute a transaction with PayPal and we decide against you, you can seek to pursue the dispute with your card issuer later.\nIf PayPal does not make a final decision on your claim until after your card issuer's deadline for filing a dispute, and because of our delay you recover less than the full amount you would have been entitled to recover from the card issuer, we will reimburse you for the remainder of your loss (minus any amount you have already recovered from the seller or your card issuer).\nBefore contacting your card issuer or filing a dispute with PayPal, you should contact the seller to attempt to resolve your issue in accordance with the seller's return policy.</p> PAYPAL USER AGREEMENT\nSelling and Accepting Payments Accepting Payments From Buyers for Goods and Services Receiving personal payments <p>The ability to receive payments varies by country/region.\nYou can determine whether you have the ability to receive payments by logging into your PayPal account.</p>\n<p>If you use your PayPal account to receive payments for the sale of goods or services or accept donations, you must:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Pay any applicable fees for receiving the funds.</li>\n<li>Not ask your buyer to send you a personal payment for a purchase.\nIf you do so, PayPal may remove your PayPal account's ability to accept payments from friends or family members.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>By integrating into your online checkout/platform any functionality intended to enable a payer without a PayPal account to send a payment to your PayPal account, you agree to all further terms of use of that functionality which PayPal will make available to you on any page on the PayPal or Braintree website (including any page for developers and our Legal Agreements page) or online platform.\nSuch further terms include the PayPal Alternative Payment Methods Terms.</p>\nNo surcharges <p>You agree that you will not impose a surcharge or any other fee for accepting PayPal as a payment method.\nYou may charge a handling fee in connection with the sale of goods or services as long as the handling fee does not operate as a surcharge and is not higher than the handling fee you charge for non-PayPal transactions.</p> Presentation of PayPal <p>You must treat PayPal payment methods or marks at least on par with any other payment methods offered at your points of sale, wherever PayPal\u2019s branded services are integrated, including your websites or mobile applications.\nThis includes at least equal or better: logo placement, position within any point of sale, and treatment in terms of payment flow, terms, conditions, restrictions, and fees, in each case as compared to other marks and payment methods at your points of sale.\nFurther, you must not present any payment method or mark upstream (or at an earlier point in the checkout experience) from the presentment of any of PayPal\u2019s services or marks.</p>\n<p>In representations to your customers or in public communications, you must not mischaracterize any PayPal service as a payment method or exhibit a preference for other payment methods over any PayPal service.\nWithin all of your points of sale, you agree not to try to dissuade or inhibit your customers from using PayPal or encourage the customer to use an alternate payment method.\nIf you enable your customers to pay you with PayPal, whenever you display or exhibit the payment methods that you accept (either within any point of sale or in your marketing materials, advertising and other customer communications), you agree to display the PayPal services payment marks at least as prominently, and in at least as positive a manner, as you do for all other payment methods.</p>\nTaxes, information reporting <p>Some of our fees may be subject to applicable taxes, levies, duties or similar governmental assessments, including, for example, value-added tax, sales tax, income tax, use or withholding taxes, assessable by any jurisdiction (collectively, \"taxes\") and, unless expressly noted, our fees are exclusive of applicable taxes.\nIt is your responsibility to determine what, if any, taxes apply to the payments you make or receive, and it is solely your responsibility to assess, collect, report and remit the correct taxes to the appropriate authority.\nPayPal is not responsible for determining whether any taxes apply to your transaction, or for calculating, collecting, reporting or remitting taxes arising from any transaction.</p> Your refund policy and privacy policy <p>You must publish a refunds and return policy, as well as a privacy policy, where required by law.</p>\nPayment review <p>PayPal reviews certain potentially high-risk transactions.\nIf PayPal determines, in its sole discretion, that a transaction is high-risk, we place a hold on the payment and provide notice to you to delay shipping of the item.\nPayPal will conduct a review and either complete or cancel the payment.\nIf the payment is completed, PayPal will provide notice to you to ship the item.\nOtherwise, PayPal will cancel the payment and the funds will be returned to the buyer, unless we are legally required to take other action.\nAll payments that complete this payment review will be eligible for PayPal Seller Protection coverage if they meet the PayPal Seller Protection requirements.\nWe will notify you by email and/or through your PayPal account.</p> In-store payments <p>If you accept PayPal payments at your physical store, you must communicate the total amount of the transaction to the customer before it takes place.\nYou may charge your customer's account only for transactions that they have authorized.\nYou must also provide customers with a physical receipt if they request one.\nYou agree that any transaction that you make shall have an accurate and true description of the goods and services being purchased.</p> Marketplace sellers <p>If you're a seller on a marketplace or through a third-party application where PayPal is offered, you must comply with any rules that apply to the marketplace's or the third party application's buyer protection program for sales you make through

the payment method for a transaction using their account to buy something from you as a seller, the transaction will be processed as a \"card not present\" transaction, even if the buyer is at your store location.</p>\nAccepting preauthorized payments <p>As a seller, you can accept payments from a buyer's account through preauthorized payments either on a one-time, regular or sporadic basis.\nThis type of transaction is sometimes called a \"billing agreement,\" \"subscription,\" \"recurring payment,\" \"reference transaction,\" \"preauthorized debit or PAD\", \"preauthorized transfer, \"pre-approved payment \" or \"automatic payment.\"</p>\n<p>If you receive preauthorized payments from buyers:</p>\n<p>You must:</p>\n<p>You must not:</p>\n<p>Get each buyer's prior authorization for the amount, frequency, and duration of any such payment.</p>\n<p>Restart future payments without the buyer's written authorization, if a buyer has stopped or canceled a preauthorized payment.</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>Provide a simple and easily accessible online cancellation procedure, if buyers sign up for preauthorized payments online.</p>\n<p>Provide buyers the ability to stop any such payment up to 3 Business Days before the date scheduled for payment.</p>\n<p>Notify the buyer at least 10 days in advance of the amount and date of each preauthorized payment if the preauthorized payment will vary from the preauthorized amount or (at the buyer's option) any payment that is in an amount that falls outside of the pre-determined range.</p> Automatic Transfer Countries <p>If you are a resident of an Automatic Transfer Country, then you have the ability to receive payments, but you must withdraw the full amount of your payment through an available withdrawal method.\nIf you do not do so, the amounts will be automatically withdrawn from your PayPal account to your withdrawal method on a regular basis.\nFor additional terms regarding Automatic Transfer, please click here.</p> Transaction Fees for Online and In-Store Payments Standard transactions fees <p>Your PayPal transaction fees depend on the buyer's country/region.\nThe fees you pay when selling goods or services and the buyer pays using their PayPal account (or using another authorized wallet) can be found on the Commercial Payments Fees table.\nPlease note that:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>We may adjust the fees applicable to future transactions that you process using PayPal.\nWe will provide you at least 14 days' advance notice of any fee increase or the introduction of a new type of fee.</li>\n<li>If you refund (partially or fully) a transaction to a buyer or a donation to a donor, there are no fees to make the refund, but the fees you originally paid as the seller will not be returned to you.</li>\n<li>If you accept payments using a PayPal product (like PayPal Payments Pro), the fees applicable to those products will apply to your transactions.</li>\n</ul> Merchant rate <p>To qualify for our merchant rate, you must submit a one-time application, have a qualifying monthly sales volume, and have a business account in good standing.\nTo view Merchant rate criteria click here.</p>\nMicropayments Fees <p>You may qualify to receive micropayments pricing for the sale of goods and services through your PayPal account, if your transactions typically average less than $10 USD.\nIn order to qualify, you must have a PayPal account that is in good standing (for example, no limitations or negative PayPal balance), you may not be processing payments using PayPal Payments Pro and you must submit an application and have it approved by us.</p>\n<p>If your PayPal account is approved to accept micropayments, then the fees found on the <strong>Micropayment Fees table</strong> will apply to all transactions for the sale of goods or services processed through your PayPal account, instead of the Commercial Payments Fees.\nIf you have multiple PayPal accounts, you must route your micropayments transactions through the appropriate account.\nOnce a transaction is processed, PayPal will not re-route the transaction through a different account.</p>\n<p>By applying for Micropayments for Digital Goods, you agree that for digital goods transactions you receive up to the amounts in the <strong>table</strong>, then if a buyer opens a Dispute, PayPal may reverse the transaction, and remove the funds from your account without requiring the buyer to escalate the dispute to a claim.</p>\nPayPal Payouts and Mass Pay fees <p>PayPal's Payouts and Mass Pay services let you send multiple payments in one batch to send commissions, rebates, rewards, and general payments.\nIn order to use these services, you must have:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>a PayPal business account in good standing and with no withdrawal limits.\nand</li>\n<li>applied for and received our permission to use these services.\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>We may remove your ability to use Payouts or Mass Pay at any time if there is a higher than acceptable level of risk associated with your use of those services.\n</p>\n<p>The amount you will pay us for these services differs according to whether you use the Payouts service or Mass Pay services, how you send the payments, and the currency of the payment.\nThese fees can be found in the PayPal Payouts and Mass Pay Fees table.</p> Refunds, Reversals and Chargebacks General information <p>If you receive a payment for selling goods or services that is later refunded or invalidated for any reason, you are responsible for the full amount of the payment sent to you plus any fees (including any applicable chargeback fee or Dispute fee described below).\nWhenever a transaction is refunded or otherwise reversed, PayPal will refund or reverse the transaction from your PayPal account in the same currency as the original transaction.\nIf your PayPal balance for a particular currency is insufficient to cover the amount of a refund or reversal, PayPal will perform a currency conversion in order to refund or reverse the transaction.\nPayPal's transaction exchange rate (including our currency conversion fee) at the time the refund or reversal is processed will be used.</p>\n<p>If you refund (partially or fully) a transaction to a buyer or a donation to a donor, there are no fees to make the refund, but the fees you originally paid as the seller will not be returned to you.\n(This will not apply to residents of Mainland China who open a PayPal account and use the PayPal services.)</p>\n<p>The buyer's account will be credited with the full payment amount, or a portion of the payment amount in the event of a partial refund, we'll retain the fixed fee portion of the fees you paid, and the amount of the refunded payment will be deducted from your PayPal account.</p>\nPayments that are invalidated and reversed <p>Payments to you may be invalidated and reversed by PayPal if:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>You lose a PayPal Buyer Protection claim submitted to us by a buyer, including as a result of your failure to respond in a timely manner.</li>\n<li>Your buyer pursues a chargeback related to a card-funded transaction and the transaction is not eligible for PayPal Seller Protection.\nThe card issuer, not PayPal, determines whether a buyer is successful when they pursue a chargeback related to a card-funded transaction.</li>\n<li>You do not fulfill the transaction as promised or you cannot provide proof of shipment or proof of delivery when required.</li>\n<li>eBay decides against you under its money back guarantee program (and you haven't opted out).</li>\n<li>Our investigation of a bank reversal made by a buyer or the buyer's bank finds that the transaction was fraudulent.</li>\n<li>PayPal sent the payment to you in error.</li>\n<li>The payment was unauthorized.</li>\n<li>You received the payment for activities that violated this user agreement, the PayPal Acceptable Use Policy or any other agreement between you and PayPal.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>When you receive a payment, you are liable to PayPal for the full amount of the payment sent to you plus any fees if the payment is later invalidated for any reason.\nIf the buyer paid in another currency, the full amount of the payment sent to you may be calculated in that currency, using PayPal's transaction exchange rate (including our currency conversion fee) at the time the refund or reversal is processed.\nIf your PayPal balance is insufficient to cover your liability for the payment amount plus the fees, then this will result in a negative PayPal balance.\nAny negative PayPal balance represents an amount that you owe to us, and, in this situation, you must immediately add funds to your PayPal balance to eliminate it.\nIf you do not do so, PayPal may:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>recover any amounts due to PayPal by debiting your balance;</li>\n<li>engage in collection efforts to recover such amounts from you;</li>\n<li>take any and all action as outlined under Amounts owed to PayPal.\nor</li>\n<li>place a limitation or take other action on your PayPal account as outlined under Restricted Activities and Holds.</li>\n</ul>\nDispute fees<p>PayPal will charge a <strong>Dispute fee</strong> to sellers for facilitating the online dispute resolution process for transactions that are processed either through a buyer\u2019s PayPal account or through a PayPal guest checkout<strong>.\n</strong>The <strong>Dispute fee</strong> applies when the buyer pursues a claim directly with PayPal, a chargeback with their card issuer, or a reversal with their bank.\nThe <strong>Dispute fee&nbsp;</strong>will be charged at either the <strong>Standard Dispute fee </strong>rate or the <strong>High Volume Dispute fee </strong>rate.\nThe <strong>Dispute fee&nbsp;</strong>will be charged in the currency which you selected for the original transaction listing.\nIf the transaction was in a currency not listed in the <strong>Dispute fee&nbsp;</strong>table, the fee charged will be in your primary holding currency.\nThe <strong>Dispute fee&nbsp;</strong>will be deducted from your PayPal account after the claim is decided.</p>\n<p>The <strong>Dispute fee</strong> amount will be determined when the dispute is created.\nThe fee is based on the ratio of the total transaction amount of your claims compared to the total amount of your sales for the previous three calendar months.\nFor example, for a dispute raised in September, your disputes ratio will be calculated by considering your total claims to sales ratio over June, July and August.\nYour total claims include all claims filed directly with and escalated to PayPal, except claims for <strong>Unauthorized Transactions</strong>\n<strong>, </strong>and all chargebacks from the buyer\u2019s card issuer or reversals from the buyer\u2019s bank.</p>\n<p>If your Disputes Ratio is 1.5% or more and you had more than 100 sales transactions in the previous three full calendar months, you will be charged the <strong>High Volume Dispute fee</strong> for each dispute.\nOtherwise, you will be charged the <strong>Standard Dispute fee</strong> for each dispute.</p>\n<p>You will <strong>\n<u>not</u>\n</strong> be charged a <strong>Standard Dispute fee </strong>for disputes that are<em>:</em>\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Inquiries in PayPal\u2019s <strong>Resolution Center</strong> that are not escalated to a claim with PayPal.</li>\n<li>Resolved directly between you and the buyer and not escalated to a claim with PayPal.</li>\n<li>Filed by the buyer directly with PayPal as an <strong>Unauthorized Transaction</strong>.</li>\n<li>Eligible for <strong>PayPal\u2019s Seller Protection</strong> program.</li>\n<li>Claims with a transaction value that is less than twice the amount of a <strong>Standard Dispute fee.</strong>\n</li>\n<li>Decided in your favour by PayPal or your issuer.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>You will <strong>\n<u>not</u>\n</strong> be charged a <strong>High Volume Dispute fee</strong> for disputes that are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Inquiries in PayPal\u2019s <strong>Resolution Center</strong> and not escalated to a claim with PayPal.</li>\n<li>Resolved directly between you and the buyer and not escalated to a claim with PayPal.</li>\n<li>Filed by the buyer directly with PayPal as an <strong>Unauthorized Transaction</strong>.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Sellers charged <strong>High Volume Dispute fees </strong>may be required to provide a remediation plan which includes an explanation of the cause of the increased dispute rate, the actions taken to reduce disputes, and the timelines for those actions.</p>\n<p>Disputes listed above may be excluded from being charged a <strong>Standard Dispute fee</strong> or a <strong>High Volume Dispute fee</strong>, but the claim itself may still be included in the overall calculation of your dispute ratio.</p>\n<p>This Dispute fees section does not apply to residents of Malaysia who open a PayPal account and use the PayPal services.</p>\nChargeback fees<p>For transactions that are not processed either through a buyer\u2019s PayPal account or through a guest checkout, and where the buyer pursues a chargeback for the transaction with their card issuer, PayPal will charge you a chargeback fee for facilitating the chargeback process.\nThis fee will apply regardless of whether the buyer is successful in pursuing the chargeback with the card issuer.</p>\n<p>The applicable chargeback fee will be deducted from your PayPal account.\nThe chargeback fee is the amount specified on the Chargeback Fees table in the currency of the original transaction.\nIf the transaction was in a currency not listed in the Chargeback fee table, the fee charged will be in your primary holding currency.</p>\n<p>If a buyer files a chargeback, the card issuer, not PayPal, will determine who wins the chargeback.\nThe chargeback fee is applied as specified in the Chargeback Fee Table in the currency of the original transaction.\nIf the transaction is in a currency not listed in the Chargeback Fee Table the fee assessed in your primary holding currency.</p>\nImpact of various Buyer Protection processes on sellers <p>You should read and understand PayPal's Buyer Protection program and if you sell goods and services to and receive payments from buyers with PayPal accounts in countries/regions other than your own, you should also be familiar with the PayPal Buyer Protection available to buyers in each of those countries/regions.\nBuyers' rights under these programs may impact you as a seller.\nYou can find this information for PayPal's programs on the Legal Agreements page by selecting your buyer's location at the top of the page and referring to the applicable user agreement for that geography.</p>\n<p>If you lose a claim under PayPal's Buyer Protection program in any country/region:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>You will be required to reimburse PayPal for your liability.</li>\n<li>Your liability will include the full purchase price of the item plus the original shipping cost (and in some cases you may not receive the item back), and the PayPal fees that you were charged for the transaction.</li>\n<li>You will not receive a refund of the PayPal fees that you paid in connection with the sale.</li>\n<li>If the claim was that the item received was Significantly Not as Described, you may not receive the item back, or you may be required to accept the item back and pay for the return shipping costs.</li>\n<li>If the claim was that the item received was Significantly Not as Described and related to an item you sold that is counterfeit, you will be required to provide a full refund to the buyer and you may not receive the item back.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If you accept PayPal payments from buyers for goods or services you sell through eBay, then you need to read and understand the eBay Money Back Guarantee program.\nUnless you opt out by calling eBay, PayPal will treat eBay's decisions in favor of your buyers under that program as a basis for reversing a PayPal payment made to you.\nIf your PayPal balance is insufficient to cover the amount, we may:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Place a hold on your PayPal account until sufficient funds become available in your PayPal account to cover such claim.\nor</li>\n<li>Create a negative balance in your PayPal account.</li>\n</ul> PayPal's Seller Protection Program <p>We offer Seller Protection based on the Seller Protection program for the country/region you selected when you opened your account.\nThe Seller Protection program for the following countries/regions are part of this user agreement.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>Indonesia, Malaysia, Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam</strong>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Central Europe, Middle East and Africa</strong> (excluding Austria, Germany, Switzerland, the United Kingdom and other countries covered by a country/region-specific User Agreement)</li>\n</ul> What's eligible <p>If you sell something to a buyer and the transaction is later disputed or reversed under <strong>Reversals, Claims or Chargebacks</strong>, you may be eligible for reimbursement under PayPal's Seller Protection program.\nWhen it applies, PayPal's Seller Protection program entitles you to retain the full purchase amount.\nThere is no limit on the number of payments for which you can receive coverage.\nBy accessing the transaction details page in your PayPal account you can determine whether or not your transaction is eligible for protection under this program.</p>\n<p>PayPal's Seller Protection program may apply when a buyer claims that:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>They did not authorize or benefit from funds sent from their PayPal account (referred to as an \"<strong>Unauthorized Transaction</strong>\" and the Unauthorized Transaction occurs in an environment hosted by PayPal.\nor</li>\n<li>They did not receive the item from you (referred to as an \"<strong>Item Not Received</strong>\" claim).</li>\n</ul>\n<p>PayPal's Seller Protection program may also apply when a transaction is reversed because of a successful chargeback by a buyer or when a bank funded payment is reversed by the buyer's bank.</p>\n<p>This section describes PayPal's Seller Protection program as it applies to you, but you should also be familiar with the <strong>Impact of various Buyer Protection processes on sellers</strong>.</p>\nBasic requirements<p>To be eligible for PayPal's Seller Protection, all of the following basic requirements must be met, as well as any applicable additional requirements:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>You provide us with valid proof of shipment or proof of delivery.</li>\n<li>The item must be a tangible item except for items subject to the Intangible Goods Additional Requirements.</li>\n<li>You must ship the item to the shipping address on the transaction details page in your PayPal account for the transaction.\nIf you originally ship the item to the recipient's shipping address on the transaction details page but the item is later redirected to a different address, you will not be eligible for PayPal Seller Protection.\nWe therefore recommend not using a shipping service that is arranged by the buyer, so that you will be able to provide valid proof of shipping and delivery.</li>\n<li>You must respond to PayPal's requests for documentation and other information in a timely manner as requested in our email correspondence with you or in our correspondence with you through the Resolution Centre.\nIf you do not respond to PayPal's request for documentation and other information in the time requested, you may not be eligible for Seller Protection.</li>\n<li>If the sale involves pre-ordered or made-to-order goods, you must ship within the timeframe you specified in the listing.\nOtherwise, it is recommended that you ship all items within 7 days after receipt of payment.</li>\n<li>You must accept payment from a PayPal account for the purchase (partial payment and/or payment in installments are excluded).</li>\n<li>The payment must be marked \u201celigible\u201d or \u201cpartially eligible\u201d in the case of Unauthorized Transaction claims, or \u201celigible\u201d in the case of Item Not Received claims, for PayPal's Seller Protection on the Transaction Details page.\n</li>\n</ul>\nItem Not Received additional requirement<p>To be eligible for PayPal's Seller Protection program for a buyer's Item Not Received claim, you must meet both the basic requirements and the additional requirements listed below:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Where a buyer files a chargeback with the issuer for a card-funded transaction, the payment must be marked \"eligible\" or \"partially eligible\" for PayPal's Seller Protection on the transaction details page.</li>\n<li>You must provide proof of delivery as described below.</li>\n</ul> Intangible Goods additional requirements <p>For the sale of intangible goods and services to be eligible for Seller Protection, the sale must meet the basic requirements and the following additional requirements: </p>\n<ul>\n<li>Integration requirements:</li>\n<ul>\n<li>Where you have integrated a PayPal checkout product, you must be using the current version of that product if you are accepting payments directly via a website or mobile optimized website.\nor</li>\n<li>Ensure you are passing session information to PayPal at checkout if you are integrated with PayPal via a third-party or if you have a native app integration.</li>\n<li>Other integration requirements may apply depending on your business model.\nWe will let you know those requirements ahead of time, if needed.</li>\n</ul>\n<li>Paid standard transaction fees on the sale.</li>\n<li>Delivered the item and provide Proof of shipment or delivery for Intangible Goods.</li>\n<li>Provide signature confirmation when the full amount of the payment (including shipping and taxes) exceeds the amount (based on the currency of the payment) listed in the signature confirmation threshold table.\nIf the full amount of the payment (including shipping and taxes) is in a currency not listed in the table, then signature confirmation is required when the payment exceeds the equivalent of $750 USD at the PayPal exchange rate that applies at the time the transaction is processed.</li>\n</ul>\nEstablishing proof of delivery or proof of shipment <p>\n<strong>Physical Goods</strong>\n</p>\n<p>The following is required as proof of shipment or delivery for physical goods:</p>\n<p>Proof of shipment</p>\n<p>Proof of delivery</p>\n<p>Online or physical documentation from a shipping company that includes:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Date of shipment</li>\n<li>An address for the recipient that matches the shipping address on the transaction details page</li>\n<li>An address for the recipient showing at least the city, country, or postal zip code (or international equivalent).</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Online or physical documentation from a shipping company that includes:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Date of delivery and \"delivered\" status of the item or service.</li>\n<li>An address for the recipient showing at least the city, country, or postal zip code (or international equivalent).</li>\n<li>Signature confirmation when the full amount of the payment (including shipping and taxes exceeds) the fixed amount (based on the currency of the payment) listed in the signature confirmation threshold table .\nSignature confirmation is online documentation, viewable at the shipping company's website, indicating that the item was signed for (save for Sellers having a PayPal Account registered in Albania, Andorra, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, and Ukraine to whom such requirement won't apply).</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n<strong>IMPORTANT</strong>: Your choice of carrier and shipment options with that carrier can have a big impact on your ability to meet the proof of delivery requirements.\nPlease ensure, especially when shipping goods internationally, that your carrier can provide \u2018delivered' status at the correct address, or your Seller Protection claim may be denied.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Intangible Goods</strong>\n</p>\n<p> The following is required as proof of shipment or delivery for intangible goods:</p>\n<p>For intangible or digital goods, proof of shipment or delivery means compelling evidence to show the item was delivered or the purchase order was fulfilled.\nCompelling evidence could include a system of record showing the date the item was sent and that it was either:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Electronically sent to the recipient, including the recipient\u2019s address (email, IP, etc.), where applicable.\nor</li>\n<li>Received or accessed by the recipient</li>\n</ul> Signature confirmation currency thresholds

payments with any of the payment methods linked to your PayPal account, restricting your ability to send payments or make withdrawals;</li>\n<li>Hold your PayPal balance if reasonably needed to protect against the risk of liability to PayPal or a third party, or if you have violated our Acceptable Use Policy;</li>\n<li>Suspend your eligibility for PayPal's Buyer Protection program and/or PayPal's Seller Protection program;</li>\n<li>Contact buyers who have purchased goods or services from you using PayPal, your bank or credit card issuer, other impacted third parties or law enforcement about your actions;</li>\n<li>Update inaccurate information you provided us;</li>\n<li>Take legal action against you;</li>\n<li>Hold, apply or transfer the funds in your PayPal account as required by judgments and orders which affect you or your PayPal account, including judgments and orders issued by courts in Singapore or elsewhere and directed to PayPal or its affiliates;</li>\n<li>If you've violated our Acceptable Use Policy, then you're also responsible for damages to PayPal caused by your violation of this policy.\nor</li>\n<li>If you violate the Acceptable Use Policy, then in addition to being subject to the above actions you will be liable to PayPal for the amount of PayPal's damages caused by your violation of the Acceptable Use Policy.\nYou acknowledge and agree that $2,500 USD (or equivalent) per violation of the Acceptable Use Policy is presently a reasonable minimum estimate of PayPal's actual damages considering all currently existing circumstances, including the relationship of the sum to the range of harm to PayPal that reasonably could be anticipated because, due to the nature of the violations of the Acceptable Use Policy, actual damages would be impractical or extremely difficult to calculate.\nPayPal may deduct such damages directly from any existing PayPal balance in any PayPal account you control.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If we close your PayPal account or terminate your use of the PayPal services for any reason, we'll provide you with notice of our actions and make any unrestricted funds held in your PayPal account available for withdrawal.</p>\n<p>You are responsible for all reversals, chargebacks, claims, fees, fines, penalties and other liability incurred by PayPal, any PayPal customer, or a third party caused by or arising out of your breach of this user agreement, and/or your use of the PayPal services.</p> Holds, Limitations and Reserves What are holds, limitations and reserves <p>Under certain circumstances, in order to protect PayPal and the security and integrity of the network of buyers and sellers that use the PayPal services, PayPal may take account-level or transaction-level actions.\nUnless otherwise noted, if we take any of the actions described here, we'll provide you with notice of our actions, but we retain the sole discretion to take these actions.\nTo request information in connection with an account limitation, hold or reserve, you should visit the Resolution Centre or follow the instructions in our email notice with respect to the limitation, hold or reserve.</p>\n<p>Our decision about holds, limitations and reserves may be based on confidential criteria that are essential to our management of risk and the protection of PayPal, our customers and/or service providers.\nWe may use proprietary fraud and risk modeling when assessing the risk associated with your PayPal account.\nIn addition, we may be restricted by regulation or a governmental authority from disclosing certain information to you about such decisions.\nWe have no obligation to disclose the details of our risk management or security procedures to you.</p>\n<p>In order to facilitate PayPal\u2019s actions described above and allow us to assess the level of risk associated with your PayPal account, you agree to cooperate with PayPal\u2019s reasonable requests for financial statements and other documentation or information in a timely fashion.</p>\nHolds<p>A hold is an action that PayPal may take under certain circumstances either at the transaction level or the account level.\nWhen PayPal places a temporary hold on a payment, the funds shall not be available to either the sender or the recipient.\nPayPal reviews many factors before placing a hold on a payment, including: account tenure, transaction activity, business type, past customer disputes, and overall customer satisfaction.\nSome common situations where PayPal will hold payments include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>New sellers or sellers who have limited selling activity.</li>\n<li>Payments for higher-risk categories like electronics or tickets.</li>\n<li>Sellers who have performance issues, or a high rate of buyer dissatisfaction or disputes.</li>\n</ul>\nHolds based on PayPal\u2019s risk decisions<p>We may place a hold on payments sent to your PayPal account if, in our sole discretion, we believe that there may be a high level of risk associated with you, your PayPal account, or your transactions or that placing such a hold is necessary to comply with regulatory requirements.\nWe make decisions about whether to place a payment hold based on a number of factors, including information available to us from both internal sources and third parties.\nWhen we place a hold on a payment, the funds will appear in your PayPal account with an indication that they are unavailable or pending.\nWe'll notify you, either through your PayPal account or directly by phone or email, whenever we place a hold.\n</p>\n<p>Risk-based holds generally remain in place for up to 30 days from the date the payment was received into your PayPal account unless PayPal has a reason to continue to hold the payment.\nWe may release the hold earlier under certain circumstances (for example, if you've uploaded shipment tracking information related to the transaction), but any earlier release is at our sole discretion.\nThe hold may last longer than 30 days if the payment is challenged as a payment that should be invalidated and reversed based on a disputed transaction as discussed in the following paragraph below.\nIn this case, we'll hold the payment in your PayPal account until the matter is resolved.</p>\nHolds related to Marketplace transactions<p>If you're a seller on a marketplace or through a third-party application where PayPal is offered, a hold may be placed on a payment sent to you at the instruction of the applicable marketplace or third-party.\nThis is done once you have granted us permission to have your funds held and will be in accordance with your agreement with the third-party.\nThese holds will appear in your PayPal account.\nIf you have questions about why the applicable marketplace or third party instructed PayPal to put these holds in place, you will need to contact the marketplace or third-party directly.</p>\nHolds based on disputed transactions<p>If a payment sent to you as a seller is challenged as a payment that should be invalidated and reversed, we may place a temporary hold on the funds in your PayPal account to cover the amount that could be reversed.\nAny of the situations described under Refunds, Reversals and Chargebacks are situations that could result in us placing a hold on a payment.\nIf we determine the transaction should not be reversed, we'll lift the temporary hold.\nIf we determine the transaction should be reversed, we'll remove the funds from your PayPal account.</p>\nAccount Limitations<p>Limitations prevent you from completing certain actions with your PayPal account, such as withdrawing, sending or receiving payments.\nThese limitations are implemented to help protect PayPal, buyers and sellers when we notice restricted activities, an increased financial risk, or activity that appears to us as unusual or suspicious.\nLimitations also help us collect information necessary for keeping your PayPal account open.</p>\n<p>There are several reasons why we may limit your access to your PayPal account or the PayPal services, and/or limit access to your funds, including:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>If we suspect someone could be using your PayPal account without your knowledge, we'll limit it for your protection and look into the fraudulent activity.</li>\n<li>If your debit or credit card issuer alerts us that someone has used your card without your permission.\nSimilarly, if your bank lets us know that there have been unauthorized transfers between your PayPal account and your bank account.</li>\n<li>In order to comply with applicable law.</li>\n<li>If we reasonably believe you have breached this agreement or violated the Acceptable Use Policy.</li>\n<li>Seller performance indicating your PayPal account is high risk.\nExamples include: indications of poor selling performance because you've received an unusually high number of claims and chargebacks selling an entirely new or high cost product, or if your typical sales volume increases rapidly.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If we limit access to your PayPal account, we'll provide you with notice of our actions and the opportunity to request restoration of access if, in our sole discretion, we deem it appropriate.</p>\n<p>You will need to resolve any issues with your account before a limitation can be removed.\nNormally, this is done after you provide us with the information we request.\nHowever, if we reasonably believe a risk still exists after you have provided us that information, we may take action to protect PayPal, our users, a third party, or you from reversals, fees, fines, penalties, legal and/or regulatory risks and any other liability.</p>\nReserves<p>We may place a reserve on your PayPal account if we believe there may be a high level of risk associated with you, your PayPal account, your business model, or your transactions.\nWhen we place a reserve on your PayPal account, it means that all or some of the transactions will be shown as \"pending\" in your PayPal balance, and you will not be able to withdraw funds in a \"pending\" status, in order to protect against the risk of transactions made by you being reversed or invalidated or any other risk related to your PayPal account or use of the PayPal services.\nWe make decisions about whether to place a reserve based on a number of factors, including information available to us from both internal sources and from third parties.</p>\n<p>PayPal considers a list of non-exclusive factors, and whether and how these factors have changed over time, including:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>How long you have been in business.</li>\n<li>Whether your industry has a higher likelihood of chargebacks.</li>\n<li>Your payment processing history with PayPal and other providers.</li>\n<li>Your business and/or personal credit history.</li>\n<li>Your delivery time frames.</li>\n<li>Whether you have higher than average number of returns, chargebacks, claims or disputes.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If we place a reserve on funds in your account, we'll notify you of our actions and the terms of the reserve.</p>\n<p>There are two types of reserves that may be placed on your PayPal account, and one or both may be applied at the same time:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>A Rolling reserve</strong> is a reserve where a percentage of each transaction you receive each day is held and then released later on a scheduled basis.\nFor example, your reserve could be set at 10% and held for a 90-day rolling period \u2013 meaning 10% of the funds you receive on day 1 are held and then released on day 91, 10% of the funds you receive on day 2 are held until day 92, etc.\nRolling reserves are the most common type of reserve.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>A Minimum reserve</strong> is a specific minimum amount that you're required to keep available in your PayPal balance at all times.\nThe minimum reserve is either taken as an upfront amount deposited all at once or is established on a rolling basis from percentages of sales until the minimum reserve is achieved, much like a rolling reserve.\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If we change the terms of the reserve due to a change in our risk assessment, we'll notify you of the new terms.\n</p> Court Orders, Regulatory Requirements or Other Legal Process <p>If we are notified of a court order or other legal process (including garnishment or any equivalent process) affecting you, or if we otherwise believe we are required to do so in order to comply with applicable law or regulatory requirements, we may be required to take certain actions, including holding payments to/from your PayPal account, placing a reserve or limitation on your PayPal account, or releasing your funds.\nWe will decide, in our sole discretion, which action is required of us.\nUnless the court order, applicable law, regulatory requirement or other legal process requires otherwise, we will notify you of these actions.\nWe do not have an obligation to contest or appeal any court order or legal process involving you or your PayPal account.\nWhen we implement a hold, reserve or limitation as a result of a court order, applicable law, regulatory requirement or other legal process, the hold, reserve or limitation may remain in place as long as reasonably necessary as determined by PayPal.</p> PAYPAL USER AGREEMENT\nLiability for Unauthorized Transactions Protection from Unauthorized Transactions <p>To protect yourself from unauthorized activity in your PayPal account, you should regularly log into your PayPal account and review your PayPal account statement.\nPayPal will notify you of each transaction by sending an email to your primary email address on file.\nYou should review these transaction notifications to ensure that each transaction was authorized and accurately completed.</p>\n<p>PayPal will protect you from unauthorized activity in your PayPal account.\nWhen this protection applies, PayPal will cover you for the full amount of the unauthorized activity as long as you cooperate with us and follow the procedures described below.\n</p>\nWhat is an Unauthorized Transaction<p>An \"Unauthorized Transaction\" occurs when a payment is sent from your PayPal account that you did not authorize and that did not benefit you.\nFor example, if someone steals your password, uses the password to access your PayPal account, and sends a payment from your PayPal account, an Unauthorized Transaction has occurred.</p>\nWhat is not considered an Unauthorized Transaction<p>The following are NOT considered Unauthorized Transactions:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>If you give someone access to your PayPal account (by giving them your login information) and they use your PayPal account without your knowledge or permission.\nYou are responsible for transactions made in this situation.</li>\n<li>Invalidation and reversal of a payment as a result of the actions described under Refunds, Reversals and Chargebacks.</li>\n</ul>\nReporting an Unauthorized Transaction<p>You should contact PayPal customer service immediately if you believe:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>there has been an Unauthorized Transaction sent from your account;</li>\n<li>there has been unauthorized access to your account;</li>\n<li>your PayPal login information has been lost or stolen.\nor</li>\n<li>any device you have used to access your PayPal account has been lost, stolen or deactivated.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>You must give us all the available information relating to circumstances of any Unauthorized Transactions, and/or misappropriated or unauthorized use of your account, and take all reasonable steps requested to assist PayPal in its investigation.</p>\n<p>If you notify us of an Unauthorized Transaction within 60 days of the transaction and we are satisfied that it was an Unauthorized Transaction, you will be eligible for 100% protection for the Unauthorized Transaction.</p> Error Resolution What is an Error<p>An \"Error\" means the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>a processing error made by PayPal or its suppliers in which your PayPal account is mistakenly debited or credited, or when a transaction is incorrectly recorded in your PayPal account.</li>\n<li>You send a payment and the incorrect amount is debited from your PayPal account.</li>\n<li>A transaction is missing from or not properly identified in your PayPal account statement.</li>\n<li>We make a computational or mathematical error related to your PayPal account.</li>\n</ul>\nWhat is not considered an Error<p>The following are NOT considered errors:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>If you give someone access to your PayPal account (by giving them your login information) and they use your PayPal account without your knowledge or permission.\nYou are responsible for transactions made in this situation.</li>\n<li>Invalidation and reversal of a payment as a result of the actions described under Refunds, Reversals and Chargebacks.</li>\n<li>If you erroneously send a payment to the wrong party, or send a payment for the wrong amount (based on a typographical error, for example).\n(Your only recourse in this instance will be to contact the party to whom you sent the payment and ask them to refund the payment.\nPayPal will not reimburse you or reverse a payment that you have made in error.)</li>\n</ul>\nIn case of errors or questions about your electronic transfers<p>Contact us at our Resolution Centre.</p>\n<p>Notify us as soon as you can, if you think your statement or receipt is wrong or if you need more information about a transfer listed on the statement or receipt.\nWe must hear from you no later than 60 days after we sent the FIRST statement on which the problem or error appeared.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Tell us your name, email address and account number (if any).</li>\n<li>Describe the error or the transfer you are unsure about, and explain as clearly as you can why you believe it is an error or why you need more information.</li>\n<li>Tell us the dollar amount of the suspected error.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If you tell us orally, we may require that you send us your complaint or question in writing within 10 Business Days.\nWe will complete our investigation within 10 Business Days after we receive your notification of the suspected error.\nIf we need more time, however, we may take up to 45 days to investigate your complaint or question.\nIf we decide to do this, we will credit your PayPal account within 10 Business Days for the amount you think is in error, so that you will have the provisional credit during the time it takes us to complete our investigation.\nWe will notify you of the provisional credit within 2 Business Days of the crediting.\nIf we ask you to put your complaint or question in writing and we do not receive it within 10 Business Days, we may not provisionally credit your PayPal account.</p>\n<p>For errors involving new PayPal accounts, point-of-sale transactions, or foreign-initiated transactions, we may take up to 90 days to investigate your complaint or question.\nFor new PayPal accounts (the first transaction from your account was less than 30 Business Days from the date you notify us), we may take up to 20 Business Days to complete the investigation.</p>\n<p>We will tell you the results within 3 Business Days after completing our investigation.\nIf we decide that there was no error, we will send you a written explanation of our decision.\nIf you received a provisional credit, we will remove it from your account and notify you of the date and amount of the debit.\nYou may ask for copies of the documents that we used in our investigation.</p>\n<p>If we determine that there was an error, we will promptly credit the full amount into your account within 1 Business Day of our determination.\nOr, if you have already received a provisional credit, you will be allowed to retain those amounts.</p> Processing Errors <p>We will rectify any processing error that we discover.\nIf the error results in:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>You receive less than the correct amount to which you were entitled, then we will credit your PayPal account for the difference between what you should have received and what you actually received.</li>\n<li>You receive more than the correct amount to which you were entitled, then we will debit your PayPal account for the difference between what you actually received and what you should have received.</li>\n<li>Our not completing a transaction on time or in the correct amount, then we will be responsible to you for your losses or damages directly caused by this failure, unless: <ul>\n<li>through no fault of ours, you did not have enough available funds to complete the transaction;</li>\n<li>our system was not working properly and you knew about the breakdown when you started the transaction.\nor</li>\n<li>the error was due to extraordinary circumstances outside our control (such as fire, flood or loss of Internet connection), despite our reasonable precautions.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Processing errors are not:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Delays that result from PayPal applying holds, limitations or reserves.</li>\n<li>Delays based on a payment review.</li>\n<li>Delays described under How to buy something related to the time it may take for a purchase transaction to be completed in some situations.</li>\n<li>Your errors in making a transaction (for example, mistyping an amount that you are sending).</li>\n</ul> PAYPAL USER AGREEMENT\nOther Legal Terms Communications Between You and Us <p>You agree that PayPal and its affiliates may contact you by email for marketing purposes.\nYou may opt-out of receiving

up to 10 Business Days for the opt-out to take effect.\nWe will provide factual information about your account or the PayPal services, even if you have opted-out of receiving marketing communications.</p>\n<p>If you provide us your mobile phone number, you agree that PayPal and its affiliates may contact you at that number using autodialed or prerecorded message calls or text messages to: (i) inform you about your use of the PayPal services and/or service your PayPal accounts, (ii) investigate or prevent fraud, or (iii) collect a debt.\nWe will not use autodialed or prerecorded message calls or texts to contact you for marketing purposes unless we receive your prior consent.\nWe may share your mobile phone number with service providers with whom we contract to assist us with the activities listed above, but will not share your mobile phone number with third parties for their own purposes without your consent.\nYou do not have to agree to receive autodialed or prerecorded message calls or texts to your mobile phone number in order to use and enjoy the products and services offered by PayPal.\nYou can decline to receive autodialed or prerecorded message calls or texts to your mobile phone number in several ways, including, via an email transaction receipt, in your account settings, or by contacting PayPal Customer Service.\nHowever, we may still call you directly using other means if we need to speak with you.\nStandard telephone minute and text charges may apply.</p>\n<p>PayPal may communicate with you about any PayPal account or transaction information and the PayPal services electronically.\nIt is your responsibility to keep your primary email address up to date so that PayPal can communicate with you electronically.\nYou understand and agree that if PayPal sends you an electronic communication but you do not receive it because your primary email address on file is incorrect, out of date, blocked by your service provider, or you are otherwise unable to receive electronic communications, PayPal will be deemed to have provided the communication to you effectively.</p>\n<p>Please note that if you use a spam filter that blocks or re-routes emails from senders not listed in your email address book, you must add PayPal to your email address book so that you will be able to view the communications we send to you.</p>\n<p>You can update your primary email address or street address at any time by logging into the PayPal website.\nIf your email address becomes invalid such that electronic communications sent to you by PayPal are returned, PayPal may deem your account to be inactive, and you will not be able to transact any activity using your PayPal Account until we receive a valid, working primary email address from you.</p>\n<p>PayPal reserves the right to close your account if you withdraw your consent to receive electronic communications.</p>\n<p>You will be considered to have received a communication from us, if it's delivered electronically, 24 hours after the time we post it to our website or email it to you.\nYou will be considered to have received a communication from us, if it's delivered by mail, 3 Business Days after we send it.</p>\n<p>Unless you're communicating with us about a matter where we've specified another notice address (for example, our Liability for Unauthorized Transactions and Other Errors process), written notices to PayPal must be sent by postal mail to: PayPal Pte.\nLtd., Attention: Legal Department, 5 Temasek Boulevard #09-01, Suntec Tower Five, Singapore 038985.</p>\n<p>You understand and agree that, to the extent permitted by law, PayPal may, without further notice or warning, monitor or record telephone conversations you or anyone acting on your behalf has with PayPal or its agents for quality control and training purposes or for our own protection.\nYou acknowledge and understand that while your communications with PayPal may be overheard, monitored, or recorded not all telephone lines or calls may be recorded by PayPal, and PayPal does not guarantee that recordings of any particular telephone calls will be retained or retrievable.</p> PayPal's Rights PayPal suspension and termination rights <p>PayPal, in its sole discretion, reserves the right to suspend or terminate this user agreement, access to or use of its websites, software, systems (including any networks and servers used to provide any of the PayPal services) operated by us or on our behalf or some or all of the PayPal services for any reason and at any time upon notice

obligations under this user agreement, you grant to PayPal a lien on, and security interest in and to, your PayPal balance in the possession of PayPal.</p>\nAmounts owed to PayPal <p>If your PayPal balance becomes negative for any reason, that negative PayPal balance represents an amount that you owe to PayPal.\nPayPal may set off these amounts from funds that are subsequently added to your PayPal account, either by you or from payments you receive.\nIf you have more than one PayPal account, we may set off a negative PayPal balance in one PayPal account against a PayPal balance in your other PayPal account(s).\nIf you continue using your PayPal account when it has a negative balance, you authorize PayPal to combine the negative balance with any debit or transaction sent from your account when that combination is disclosed to you in advance of initiating the debit or transaction.</p>\n<p>If you hold funds in a PayPal account in multiple currencies, and the balance for one of the currencies becomes negative for any reason, PayPal may set off the negative PayPal balance by using funds you maintain in a different currency.\nIf you have a negative balance in non-relevant currency for a period of 21 days or longer, PayPal will convert this negative balance to relevant currency.\nIn either case, a currency conversion will be necessary, and PayPal's transaction exchange rate (including our currency conversion fee) will be used.</p>\n<p>In addition to the above, if you have a past due amount owed to PayPal, our affiliates, or eBay, PayPal may debit your PayPal account to pay any amounts that are past due.\nThis includes amounts owed by using our various products such as Xoom or Braintree.</p>\nInsolvency proceedings<p>If any proceeding by or against you is commenced under any provision of any bankruptcy or insolvency law, we'll be entitled to recover all reasonable costs or expenses (including reasonable legal fees and expenses) incurred in connection with the enforcement of this user agreement.</p>\nAssumption of rights<p>If PayPal invalidates and reverses a payment that you made to a recipient (either at your initiative or otherwise), you agree that PayPal assumes your rights against the recipient and third parties related to the payment, and may pursue those rights directly or on your behalf, in PayPal's discretion.</p>\nNo waiver<p>Our failure to act with respect to a breach of any of your obligations under this user agreement by you or others does not waive our right to act with respect to subsequent or similar breaches.</p> Indemnification and Limitation of Liability <p>In this section, we use the term \"PayPal\" to refer to PayPal Pte.\nLtd.\nand our affiliates, and each of their respective directors, officers, employees, agents, joint ventures, service providers and suppliers.\nOur affiliates include each entity that we control, we are controlled by or we are under common control with.</p>\nIndemnification<p>You must indemnify PayPal for actions related to your PayPal account and your use of the PayPal services.\nYou agree to defend, indemnify and hold PayPal harmless from any claim or demand (including reasonable legal fees) made or incurred by any third party due to or arising out of your breach of this user agreement, your improper use of the PayPal services, your violation of any law or the rights of a third party and/or the actions or inactions of any third party to whom you grant permissions to use your PayPal account or access our websites, software, systems (including any networks and servers used to provide any of the PayPal services) operated by us or on our behalf, or any of the PayPal services on your behalf.</p>\nLimitation of liability<p>\n<strong>PayPal's liability is limited with respect to your PayPal account and your use of the PayPal services.</strong> In no event shall PayPal be liable for lost profits or any

applicable law, PayPal is not liable, and you agree not to hold PayPal responsible, for any damages or losses (including, but not limited to, loss of money, goodwill, or reputation, profits, or other intangible losses or any special, indirect, or consequential damages) resulting directly or indirectly from: (1) your use of, or your inability to use, our websites, software, systems operated by us

reasonable efforts to ensure that requests for electronic debits and credits involving bank accounts, debit cards, credit cards, and cheque issuances are processed in a timely manner but PayPal makes no representations or warranties regarding the amount of time needed to complete processing because the PayPal services are dependent upon many factors outside of our control, such as delays in the

either a buyer or a seller, our goal is to learn about and address your concerns.\nIf we are unable to do so to your satisfaction, we aim to provide you with a neutral and cost effective means of

User Agreement About Your Account <p>This user agreement will be effective for all users as of November 9, 2020.</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>Welcome to PayPal!</p>\n<p>This user agreement is a contract between you and PayPal, Inc.\ngoverning your use of your PayPal account and the PayPal services.\nIt applies to U.S.\nPayPal accounts only.\nIf you are an individual, you must be a resident of the United States or one of its territories and at least 18 years old, or the age of majority in your state of residence to open a U.S.\nPayPal account and use the PayPal services.\nIf you are a business, the business must be organized in, operating in, or a resident of, the United States or one of its territories to open a U.S.\nPayPal account and use the PayPal services.</p>\n<p>By opening and using a PayPal account, you agree to comply with all of the terms and conditions in this user agreement.\nThe terms include an agreement to resolve disputes by arbitration on an individual basis.\nYou also agree to comply with each of the other agreements on the Legal Agreements page that apply to you and the following additional policies:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Acceptable Use Policy</li>\n<li>Electronic Communications Delivery Policy (E-Sign Disclosure and Consent)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Please read carefully all of the terms and conditions of this user agreement, terms of these policies and each of the other agreements that apply to you.</p>\n<p>We may revise this agreement and any of the policies listed above from time to time.\nThe revised version will be effective at the time we post it, unless otherwise noted.\nIf our changes reduce your rights or increase your responsibilities we will post a notice on the Policy Updates page of our website and provide you at least 21 days advance notice for personal accounts and at least 5 days advance notice for business accounts.\nBy continuing to use our services after any changes to this user agreement, you agree to abide and be bound by those changes.\nIf you do not agree with any changes to this user agreement, you may close your account.</p> Opening a PayPal Account <p>We offer two types of PayPal accounts: personal PayPal accounts and business PayPal accounts, both covered by this user agreement.</p>\n<p>All PayPal accounts let you do things like:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Send and receive money.</li>\n<li>Buy things online, using mobile devices or in stores.</li>\n<li>Make payments using your credit card, debit card, bank account, or other payment options, including funds held as balance in a business PayPal account (if we have verified the required identifying information you provide to us) or funds held in a PayPal Cash or a PayPal Cash Plus account linked to a personal PayPal account if you choose to open a PayPal Cash or a PayPal Cash Plus account.\nThe term \u201cCash Account\u201d in this user agreement will be used to refer to either a PayPal Cash or a PayPal Cash Plus account.\nMore information about Cash Accounts can be found in the PayPal Cash and PayPal Cash Plus Account Terms and Conditions.</li>\n<li>Accept credit card, debit card, bank account, Cash Account and other payment methods from others.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>You are responsible for maintaining adequate security and control of any and all IDs, passwords, personal identification numbers, or any other codes that you use to access your PayPal account and the PayPal services.\nYou must keep your mailing address, email address and other contact information current in your PayPal account profile.</p>\n<p>\n</p> Personal PayPal accounts <p>If you primarily need to make purchases and send money to family and friends, a personal PayPal account is probably right for you.\nWith a personal PayPal account you can do things like:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Send and request money from friends and family.</li>\n<li>Buy goods and services.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>You can also use a personal PayPal account to receive money for the sale of goods and services and hold that money in a linked Cash Account or transfer it to a linked bank account or debit card if you do not open a Cash Account, but if you plan to use your personal PayPal account primarily to sell things, you should open a business PayPal account.\nYou can also convert your personal PayPal account to a business PayPal account should circumstances change.</p>\n<p>\n</p> Business PayPal accounts <p>We recommend business PayPal accounts for people and organizations that primarily use PayPal to sell goods or services or accept donations, even if your business is not incorporated.\nWith a business PayPal account, you can do things like:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Use a company or business name as the name on your business PayPal account.</li>\n<li>Allow employees access to some of the features of your business PayPal account.</li>\n<li>Sign up for PayPal products that meet your business needs.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Business PayPal accounts may be subject to fees that differ from the fees applicable to personal accounts.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>By opening up a business PayPal account or converting a personal PayPal account to a business PayPal account, you certify to us that you are using it primarily for a business or commercial purpose.\nYou also consent to PayPal obtaining your personal and/or business credit report from a credit reporting agency at account opening and whenever we reasonably believe there may be an increased level of risk associated with your business PayPal account.</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\n</p> Commercial Entity Status <p>If the activity through any type of PayPal account you hold reaches certain thresholds or involves certain business segments or activities, you are required by the card networks to agree to a Commercial Entity Agreement to allow you to continue accepting Visa and MasterCard payments.\nIn this case, these Commercial Entity Agreements will apply to any payment processed by PayPal on your behalf and will form part of this user agreement.</p>\n<p>\n</p> Closing Your PayPal Account <p>You may close your PayPal account and terminate your relationship with us at any time without cost, but you will remain liable for all obligations related to your PayPal account even after the PayPal account is closed.\nWhen you close your PayPal account, we will cancel any scheduled or incomplete transactions.\nIf you have a Cash Account linked to a personal PayPal account, you must withdraw or transfer any funds held in your Cash Account before closing your personal PayPal account, and closing a personal PayPal account will result in PayPal automatically closing any linked Cash Account.\nIf you have a business PayPal account, you must withdraw or transfer any balance from your business PayPal account before closing it, and if you have not provided the required identifying information to us, or if we are unable to verify the required identifying information you provide, you must transfer any balance in your business PayPal account to a linked bank account or debit card.\nYou cannot withdraw or transfer digital gift certificates/cards that are purchased through PayPal Digital Gifts and linked to your personal or business PayPal account as payment methods.\nHowever, even without your PayPal account, you can still use the codes you received by email when you purchased the gift certificates/cards to make purchases.</p>\n<p>In certain cases, you may not close your PayPal account, including:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>To evade an investigation.</li>\n<li>If you have a pending transaction or an open dispute or claim.</li>\n<li>If your PayPal account has a negative balance.</li>\n<li>If your PayPal account is subject to a hold, limitation or reserve.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n</p> Link or Unlink a Payment Method <p>You can link or unlink certain payment methods such as a credit card, debit card, a U.S.\nbank account or PayPal Credit to your PayPal account.\nYou can also link a Cash Account to your personal PayPal account as a payment method and unlink the Cash Account by withdrawing all funds and closing it.\nPlease keep your payment method information current (e.g.\ncredit card number and expiration date).\nIf this information changes, we may update it using information and third party sources available to us without any action on your part.\nIf you do not want us to update your card information, you may remove your payment method from your PayPal account.\nIf we update your payment method, we will keep any preference setting attached to such payment method.\nYou may choose to confirm your card, so that we can verify that the card is valid and that you are the card owner.\nTo do this, we will charge $1.95 to the card.\nAfter the card is confirmed, we will immediately refund this amount to the card.</p> Receiving Funds, Holding a Balance or Transferring Funds Personal PayPal accounts <p>Money sent to your personal PayPal account cannot be held as a balance in your personal PayPal account.\nWhen you receive money to your personal PayPal account, you can:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>transfer the money via a standard transfer to your bank account linked to your personal PayPal account for free;</li>\n<li>transfer the money via an Instant Transfer to an eligible debit card or bank account linked to your personal PayPal account, subject to the fees applicable to such transfers that can

to a post office box, and we will only send a check to an address once we have confirmed that it belongs to you;</li>\n<li>open a Cash Account to hold the money as a balance in your Cash Account for purchases or to transfer funds to friends and family members.\nA Cash Account is separate account from your personal PayPal account.\nIf you open a Cash Account, we will automatically link your Cash Account to your personal PayPal account.\nMore information about Cash Accounts can be found in the PayPal Cash and PayPal Cash Plus Account Terms and Conditions.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>You also cannot transfer money to your personal PayPal account to be held as a balance in your personal PayPal account.\nYou will need to open a Cash Account to hold the money as a balance in your Cash Account, which can be used for purchases or to transfer funds to friends and family members.\nMore information about Cash Accounts can be found in the PayPal Cash and PayPal Cash Plus Account Terms and Conditions.</p>\n<p>Except as provided below, any balance in your Cash Account and any funds sent to you which have not yet been transferred to a linked bank account or debit card if you do not have a

with state money transmitter laws.\nPayPal owns the interest or other earnings on these investments.\nThese pooled amounts are held apart from PayPal\u2019s corporate funds, and PayPal will neither use these funds for its operating expenses or any other corporate purposes nor will it voluntarily make these funds available to its creditors in the event of bankruptcy.</p>\n<p>If you have a PayPal Cash Card debit card as part of a Cash Account, have enrolled in Direct Deposit, or have established Goals in PayPal, such funds will have pass-through FDIC insurance as further detailed in the PayPal Cash and PayPal Cash Plus Account Terms and Conditions.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p> Business PayPal accounts <p>Money sent to a business PayPal account can be held directly as balance in the business PayPal account.\nThe balance functionality in your business PayPal account will differ depending on whether we have been able to verify the required identifying information that you provide to us.</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>The required identifying information is:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>For sole proprietorships: name, physical address, date of birth and taxpayer identification number.\nor</li>\n<li>For other types of business legal entities: business name, business address, taxpayer identification number, and proof of business existence.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If we have not verified the required identifying information, a balance in your business PayPal account can only be held in your business PayPal account and transferred to a linked bank account or debit card or you can request PayPal to send you the money by check (subject to a non-refundable fee of $1.50, which will be deducted from the amount of the withdrawal).\nYour balance may also be used to fund payments or money owed to PayPal, such as payments on your PayPal Working Capital account or monies owed for refunds or chargebacks.</p>\n<p>If we have verified the required identifying information, a balance can be held in your business PayPal account, transferred to a linked bank account or debit card, used to make purchases or send money to others.</p>\n<p>If you have a business PayPal account and we have verified the required identifying information that you have provided to us, you may transfer money to the balance of your business PayPal account from any bank account linked to your business PayPal account by requesting an electronic transfer from your bank account.\nIf we have not verified the required identifying information that you have provided to us, you cannot add funds to your balance in a business PayPal account.</p>\n<p>You can withdraw balance from your business PayPal account by:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>transferring it via a standard transfer to a bank account linked to your business PayPal account for free,</li>\n<li>transferring it via an Instant Transfer to an eligible debit card or bank account linked to your business PayPal account, subject to the fees applicable to such transfers that can be found on the Fees for Transferring Balance (for business PayPal accounts) table and that will be disclosed to you in advance each time you initiate such a withdrawal,</li>\n<li>withdrawing it from an ATM (automated teller machine) if you have a PayPal-branded debit card (fees may apply), or</li>\n<li>Requesting a check from us (subject to a non-refundable fee of $1.50, which will be deducted from the amount of the withdrawal).\nIf you request a paper check from us, you must cash it within 180 days of the date of issuance, or we will return the funds to your balance in your business PayPal account and retain the non-refundable fee of $1.50.\nWe will not send a check to a post office box, and we will only send a check to an address once we have confirmed that it belongs to you.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Any balance you hold in your business account represents an unsecured claim against PayPal and is not insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC).</p>\n<p>PayPal is not a bank and does not itself take deposits.\nYou will not receive any interest on the funds held with PayPal.\nPayPal combines your PayPal funds with the PayPal funds of other PayPal users and invests those funds in liquid investments in accordance with state money transmitter laws.\nPayPal owns the interest or other earnings on these investments.\nHowever, the claim against PayPal represented by your PayPal funds is not secured by these investments and you do not have any ownership interest (either legal or beneficial) in these investments.\nThese pooled amounts are held apart from PayPal\u2019s corporate funds, and PayPal will neither use these funds for its operating expenses or any other corporate purposes nor will it voluntarily make these funds available to its creditors in the event of bankruptcy.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p> Restrictions on transfers or withdrawals from PayPal accounts <p>To protect us and our users from loss, we may delay a withdrawal, in certain situations, including if we need to confirm that you have authorized the withdrawal or if other payments to your PayPal account have been subject to a reversal (for example, as a result of a chargeback, bank reversal or dispute by a buyer).\nIf we place a limitation on your PayPal account, a payment is subject to a hold, or your account or an associated account has a negative balance in any currency while a withdrawal from your PayPal account is pending, you will have to reinitiate the withdrawal once the limitation or hold has been lifted, or negative balance is fully paid off.</p>\n<p>We may set limits on your withdrawals, and you can view any withdrawal limit by logging into your PayPal account.\nCompleting two out of three of the following steps can help us verify your PayPal account, which may allow us to remove any withdrawal cap:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Verifying your bank account.</li>\n<li>Linking and confirming your credit or debit card information.</li>\n<li>Providing your social security number.</li>\n</ul> Managing Your Money in Multiple Currencies Holding currency other than U.S.\ndollars <p>Your balance in your business PayPal account or in your Cash Account, if you have one, may be held in currencies other than U.S.\ndollars.</p>\n<p>If you hold a balance in your business PayPal account or in your Cash Account:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>We may allow you to convert the funds to balance in another currency.\nIf you convert funds in your account, PayPal\u2019s transaction exchange rate (including our currency conversion spread) will be used.\nWe may, at our discretion, impose limits on the amount of money you can convert or the number of conversions you can perform.</li>\n<li>You may only withdraw the funds in U.S.\ndollars.\nIn order to withdraw funds in your account held in another currency you will have to convert the currency to U.S.\ndollars, or it will be converted for you at the time of your withdrawal.\nPayPal\u2019s currency conversion rate, including our currency conversion spread, will be used.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>To receive money in a currency your account is not currently configured to accept, it may be necessary to create a balance in your business PayPal account or in your Cash Account, in that currency or convert the money into another currency.\nCertain currencies can only be received by converting the money into another currency that PayPal allows you to hold.\nIf the money is converted, PayPal\u2019s transaction exchange rate (including our currency conversion spread) will be used.</p>\n<p>You are responsible for all risks associated with maintaining multiple currencies in a PayPal Cash Account or business PayPal account.\nYou may not manage or convert multiple currencies for speculative trading purposes, conversion arbitrage, conversion options, or any other activity that PayPal determines is primarily for the purpose of gaining or making money based on currency conversion rates.\nPayPal may hold, cancel, or reverse any transaction we determine to violate this policy.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p> How we convert currency <p>If PayPal converts currency, it will be completed at the transaction exchange rate we set for the relevant currency exchange.\nThe transaction exchange rate is adjusted regularly and includes a currency conversion spread applied and retained by us on a base exchange rate to form the rate applicable to your conversion.\nThe base exchange rate is based on rates within the wholesale currency markets on the conversion day or the prior Business Day.\nor, if required by law or regulation, set at the relevant government reference rate(s).</p>\n<p>For some uses of your PayPal accounts, PayPal may determine currency conversion is necessary.\nThe applicable currency conversion spread can be found on our Fees page under the heading Currency conversion.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p> Currency conversion choices <p>When your payment is funded by a debit or credit card and PayPal determines a currency conversion is necessary, you consent to and authorize PayPal to convert the currency in place of your debit or credit card issuer.\nYou may have the right to have your card issuer perform the currency conversion, if applicable for that card issuer and network.\nCurrency preference selections may be presented to you in various forms, including a choice of which currency is used for the transaction, whether PayPal or your card issuer performs the conversion, or which conversion rate is used for the transaction, and may be made available individually for each card and for each automatic payment agreement.\nIf your card issuer converts the currency, your card issuer will determine the currency conversion rate and what fees they may charge.</p>\n<p>PayPal will always perform the conversion for transactions where your Cash Account balance, business PayPal account balance or linked bank account is the payment method.</p> Account Statements <p>You have the right to receive an account statement showing your PayPal account activity.\nYou may view your PayPal account statement by logging into your PayPal account.\nIf you have a Cash Account linked to your personal PayPal account, you will receive two statements: one showing all transactions in your personal PayPal account and an additional statement showing only transactions involving your Cash Account.</p> Sending Money and Buying Sending Money to a Friend or Family Member Sending money <p>You can send money to a friend or family member using the send money feature in your PayPal account (sometimes called \u201cpersonal payments\u201d or \u201cpeer-to-peer/P2P payments\u201d).\nYou can send money to a friend or family member even if they don\u2019t have a PayPal account at the time you send them money, using their email address or mobile number in any currency that PayPal supports, and you can choose which payment method you want to use.\nIf the person to whom you are sending money does not have a PayPal account, they can claim it by opening a PayPal account.\nIf they don\u2019t claim it, it will be refunded to you.</p>\n<p>We may, at our discretion, impose limits on the amount of money you can send, including money you send for purchases.\nYou can view any sending limit by logging into your PayPal account.</p>\n<p>When you send money to a friend or family member who has a PayPal account, one of two things may happen: they may accept or decline the money.\nIf they decline to accept the money, the money (including any fees you were charged) will be refunded to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The original payment method you used for the transaction, if you used a credit card, debit card, PayPal Credit, a Cash Account, or balance in a business PayPal account as the payment method, or</li>\n<li>The balance in your business PayPal account or the balance in your Cash Account linked to your personal PayPal account if you used a bank account as the payment method and we cannot refund it to your bank account.</li>\n<li>If you do not have a Cash Account linked to your personal PayPal account, the money will be waiting for you to claim by using one of the available transfer methods under Receiving Funds, Holding a Balance or Transferring Funds for personal PayPal accounts.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n</p> Fees for Sending Money to Friends and Family <p>The fees applicable to sending money can be found on our Fees for Sending Money to Friends and Family page and will be disclosed to you in advance each time you initiate a transaction to send money to a friend or family member.\nIf you convert money in your Cash Account balance or in your business PayPal account balance from one currency to another before sending money, PayPal\u2019s transaction exchange rate (including our currency conversion spread) will be used.\nIf you use your credit card as the payment method when sending money, you may also be charged a cash-advance fee by your card issuer.</p>\n<p>If you send money to a friend or family member from a third party (non-PayPal) website or by using a third party\u2019s product or service, then the third party will determine if the sender or recipient pays the fee.\nThis will be disclosed to you by the third party before the payment is initiated.</p>\n<p>You can also use the send money feature in your PayPal account to pay for goods or services.\nYou will not be charged any transaction fee for sending money to purchase goods or services as long as you choose the \u201csend money to pay for goods and services\u201d feature in your PayPal account.\nIn that case, the seller will pay a fee.\nYou must not use the \u201csend money to a friend or family member\u201d feature in your PayPal account when you are paying for goods or services.</p>\n<p>\n</p> Buying Something From, or Returning Something to, a Seller Who Accepts PayPal <p>&nbsp;</p> How to buy something <p>You can buy something from a seller who accepts PayPal, in any currency that the seller accepts and that PayPal supports using any payment method linked to your PayPal account.\nThis includes, for example:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Buying something at an online retailer\u2019s website and selecting PayPal as your payment method at checkout.</li>\n<li>Sending money to a seller for goods or services.</li>\n<li>Using your PayPal account to buy something at a seller\u2019s physical store using an electronic terminal, subject to certain limitations.</li>\n<li>Using your PayPal account to buy something at a seller\u2019s physical store using your own mobile device and a QR code, subject to certain limitations.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If the seller you are buying from sells goods or services and that seller does not already have a PayPal account, they can claim your payment by opening a PayPal account.\nIf they don\u2019t open a PayPal account within 30 days, your purchase will be refunded.</p>\n<p>In order to manage risk, PayPal may limit the payment methods available for a transaction when you buy something.\nIn addition, payment methods may be limited for certain sellers or if you make a PayPal payment through certain third party websites or applications.</p>\n<p>When you authorize a payment to a seller who accepts PayPal, some sellers may take up to 30 days to complete the transaction.\nIn these instances, your payment may appear as a pending order in your PayPal account.\nIn that case, your authorization of the payment will remain valid until the seller completes the transaction (but no longer than 30 days).\nIf you used a debit or credit card as the payment method, your debit or credit card issuer also may show a pending authorization for a period of time until they release the hold or receive a completed transaction.\nIf your payment requires a currency conversion by us, PayPal\u2019s transaction exchange rate (including a currency conversion spread) will be used, and may be the rate at the time the payment is processed.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p> Fees <p>When you buy something from a seller who accepts PayPal you don\u2019t pay a fee to PayPal.\nIf PayPal performs a currency conversion for your purchase, PayPal\u2019s transaction exchange rate (including our currency conversion spread) will be used.\nYour debit or credit card issuer may also charge you a separate fee for non-U.S.\ntransactions.</p>\n<p>In addition you may be required to pay a fee to PayPal if you are making a purchase using PayPal Business Payments and the seller discloses to you that you, as the buyer, must pay the fee.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p> Payment review <p>When PayPal identifies a potentially high-risk transaction, we review the transaction more closely before allowing it to proceed.\nWhen this happens, PayPal will place a hold on the transaction and notify the seller to delay shipping of the item.\nAs a buyer, this may delay your receipt of the item you purchased.\nIf we clear the transaction, we will notify the seller and direct them to ship the item.\nIf we don\u2019t clear the transaction, we will cancel it and return the funds to you, unless we are legally required to take other action.</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p> Automatic payments <p>You can agree with a seller who accepts PayPal to use PayPal as the payment method for future purchases with that seller.\nThis agreement is between you and the seller and allows you to pay the seller on a one-time, recurring or sporadic basis.\nExamples of automatic payments that can be arranged by you either with a seller or with PayPal include those that PayPal calls a \u201cbilling agreement,\u201d \"subscription,\" \"recurring payment,\u201d \u201creference transaction,\u201d \"preauthorized transfer\" or \"preapproved payment.\"</p>\n<p>If you have a personal PayPal account, you may cancel a recurring automatic payment up to 3 <strong>Business Days</strong> before the date of the next scheduled payment from your account settings or by contacting us through the <strong>PayPal Help Center</strong>, or by calling PayPal at (888) 221-1161.</p>\n<p>Once your automatic payment is canceled, all future automatic payments under your agreement with that seller will be stopped.\nIf you cancel an automatic payment, you may still owe the seller money for the purchase or have additional obligations to the seller for any goods or services that you receive but have not paid for.</p>\n<p>If you have given advance authorization, either to a seller or to PayPal, that permits a seller to take or receive payments from your PayPal account on a regularly recurring basis (for example, every month or otherwise on a routine billing cycle), and if such payments will vary in amount, you have the right to advance notice of the amount and date of the transfer from the seller at least 10 days before the transfer is made.\nIf the seller provides the option, you may choose to receive this advance notice only when the amount of your automatic payment will fall outside a range established between you and the seller.</p>\n<p>If you have authorized an automatic payment and PayPal performs currency conversion for an automatic payment transaction, PayPal will use the transaction exchange rate (including PayPal\u2019s <strong>currency conversion spread</strong>) in effect at the time the automatic payment transaction is processed.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p> Refunds <p>When you buy something from a seller online using PayPal and the transaction is ultimately refunded, the money will typically be refunded to the original payment method you used for the transaction if you used a debit card, credit card, PayPal Credit, or a balance in your Cash Account or business PayPal account.</p>\n<p>If you used a bank account linked to a personal PayPal account as the payment method for the transaction, we will attempt to refund the money to your bank account.\nIf we are unable to do so, we will refund the money to your linked Cash Account if you have one.\nIf you do not have a Cash Account, the money will be waiting for you to claim by using one of the available transfer methods under Receiving Funds, Holding a Balance or Transferring Funds for personal PayPal accounts.</p>\n<p>If you used a bank account linked to a business PayPal account as the payment method for the transaction, we will attempt to refund the money to your bank account.\nIf we are unable to do so, we will refund the money to your balance in your business PayPal account.</p>\n<p>For purchases you make in a seller\u2019s store location that you paid for using your personal PayPal account and the transaction is ultimately refunded, the money will be refunded to your Cash Account if you have one.\nIf you do not have a Cash Account, the money will be waiting for you to claim by using one of the available transfer methods under Receiving Funds, Holding a Balance or Transferring Funds for personal PayPal accounts.</p>\n<p>For purchases you make in a seller\u2019s store location that you paid for using your business PayPal account and the transaction is ultimately refunded, the money will be refunded to your balance in your business PayPal account.</p>\n<p>If you used Pay with Rewards to fund your transaction, your refund will be processed back as a dollar amount: depending on your card agreement with your issuer, your issuer may or may not credit your purchase back to your reward balance.</p>\n<p>If PayPal performed currency conversion for your transaction and a refund is issued:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Within 1 day of the date of the original payment, PayPal\u2019s transaction exchange rate (including a <strong>currency conversion spread</strong>) used at the time of the original payment will apply.</li>\n<li>Beyond 1 day of the date of the original payment, PayPal\u2019s transaction exchange rate (including a <strong>currency conversion spread</strong>) on the date of the refund will apply.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Money will be refunded in the currency you paid.\nor if we are unable to refund in the currency you paid, in your primary holding currency.\nor we are unable to refund in your primary holding currency, then in U.S.\ndollars.</p> Payment Method Used for My Transaction <p>&nbsp;</p> Selecting a preferred payment method <p>You can choose any of the payment methods in your PayPal account as your preferred payment method.\nYou can select a preferred payment method in your account preferences on <strong>www.paypal.com</strong> or in the PayPal app.\nThere may be times when your preferred payment method cannot be used, for example, if you select a credit card that is expired.</p>\n<p>You can set separate preferred payment methods for online transactions, in-store transactions, and each of your automatic payment agreements, as described below.</p>\n<p>If you have chosen a preferred payment method, it will be shown as the primary method of payment.</p>\n<p>If no preferred payment method, it\u2019s still your choice.</p>\n<p>The availability of certain payment methods may be limited based on that particular seller or the third party website you are using to complete the transaction.</p>\n<p>If you have not selected a preferred payment method, or your preferred payment method is unavailable, we will show you available payment methods, including the payment method you used most often or most recently, at the time of transaction.\nYou can also click on the \u201cManage\u201d link to see all of your available payment methods, or add a new one, and select a payment method during the transaction.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p> Backup payment method <p>Certain one-time online transactions may require that a backup funding method be used in the event that your selected or preferred payment method is unavailable.\nIn those instances, the backup funding method may be displayed to you on your transaction review page, before you complete the transaction.\nNote that this only applies for one-time, online transactions, and not for in-store or automatic payments.\nIf PayPal determines currency conversion is necessary for a transaction that also requires a backup payment method, you may not be able to separately choose whether PayPal or your card issuer performs the currency conversion on your backup payment method.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p> Sending money to friends and family <p>When you send money to friends and family within the U.S.\nusing balance in your Cash Account linked to your personal PayPal account, the balance in your business PayPal account, or your bank account, we waive all fees, so we always show you these payment options first, even if you have a set preferred payment method for your online purchases.\nRemember, you always have the choice to select any payment method in your PayPal account by clicking the \u201cChange\u201d link on the Send Money page.\nIf you select a payment method with a fee, we will always show you the fee before you send money.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p> Automatic payments <p>Some sellers allow you to store PayPal as the way you pay when making purchases on their site, so you can check out faster.\nOften, this entails creating an agreement with the seller that permits them to request that we charge your PayPal account each time you make a purchase.\nTo help minimize disruptions in your automatic payments, we may update your Payment Method information.\nsee Link or Unlink a Payment Method.</p>\n<p>When you first set up an automatic payment agreement, you may have the option to set up a preferred payment method for such agreement.\nYou can review, set, or change a preferred payment method for an automatic payment agreement in your account settings on paypal.com.</p>\n<p>Your preferred payment method for an automatic payment agreement will be used for transactions with that seller.\nIf you have available balance in a linked Cash or cash Plus account, that balance may be used before your preferred payment method.</p>\n<p>If you have not set a preferred payment method for an automatic payment agreement, or if your preferred payment method for an automatic payment agreement is unavailable (for example, because it is expired or has insufficient funds) the payment method used will be in the following order, if applicable: 1.\nCash Account (if one is linked to your personal PayPal account) or balance in your business PayPal account (if we\u2019ve been able to verify the <strong>required identifying information</strong> you provide to us).\n2.\nBank account.\n3.\nPayPal co-branded debit card.\n4.\nPayPal co-branded credit card.\n5.\nDebit card.\n6.\nCredit card.\nand 7.\nE-check.\nThis is also the order of payment methods that will be used if a previously selected payment method to be used in a seller agreement is unavailable.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p> Bank account transfers <p>When you use your bank account as a payment method, you are allowing PayPal to initiate a transfer from your bank account to the recipient.\nFor these transactions, PayPal will make electronic transfers from your bank account in the amount you specify.\nYou authorize PayPal to try this transfer again if the initial transfer is rejected by your bank for any reason.</p>\n<p>If you use your PayPal account to pay for an item and you select your bank account as the funding method for the transaction, remember that your PayPal account is issued to you by PayPal and not your bank.\nThe terms, benefits, and protections associated with your PayPal account may vary from those that apply to your bank account.\nIf you use your PayPal account to make a purchase that exceeds the balance in your linked bank account, you could incur overdraft fees, even if you chose not to allow overdrafts with your bank.\nSimilarly, the liability limits applicable to your PayPal account may differ from those applicable to your bank account.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p> E-check <p>E-check is a payment method where you use your bank account as your payment method, and the payment is not received by the recipient until the transaction is processed from the bank.\nThis process usually takes 3-5 Business Days, but this amount of time will increase if the payment is sent from a bank account located outside the United States.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p> Pay with Rewards <p>PayPal may allow you to redeem rewards associated with your eligible card(s) when making a purchase with your PayPal account through PayPal\u2019s Pay with Rewards program.\nPayPal may share with and receive information from your issuer about your issuer accounts to complete the redemption of your rewards when using PayPal\u2019s Pay with Rewards program.\nThe exchange of this information is necessary to complete the purchase when you select the Pay with Rewards redemption option.</p> All Pay with Rewards redemptions are subject to the terms of your card agreement with your card issuer.\nPay with Rewards is only available for eligible purchases with certain merchants, and PayPal or your issuer may limit, suspend, or terminate your ability to redeem rewards at any time in accordance with this user agreement and your card agreement.\nYour issuer determines the value of rewards redeemed through PayPal and available redemption methods (e.g., to pay for your purchase or for a statement credit).\nThere may be a delay between checkout and processing of your payment.\nOnly rewards available upon processing of your payment will be used.\nBecause your reward balance and/or transaction balance may change, whenever you request to redeem rewards for a purchase you also authorize PayPal to charge up to the full payment amount to your associated card if that happens.\nFor more information on redeeming rewards and how it works, please see About Payment Methods.\n<p>&nbsp;</p> Debit card processing <p>PayPal will process your debit or prepaid card funded transactions through either the ATM debit network or the Visa, MasterCard or Discover network.\nIf we process your debit or prepaid card through an ATM debit network, we may provide you with the opportunity to switch to a Visa, MasterCard or Discover network by changing your preferences for that debit or prepaid card through your PayPal account profile.</p> Loyalty Cards <p>If you use the PayPal application on your mobile phone, you may store loyalty card numbers or bar codes, where applicable, for certain sellers in your PayPal account.\nWhen you store your loyalty card numbers or bar codes in your PayPal account, you will earn any rewards, subject to the seller\u2019s loyalty card terms and conditions, at the time you make your payment to the merchant by presenting the stored loyalty card number or bar code to the seller at the point of sale.\nIt is your responsibility to make sure you have entered your loyalty card information correctly and that you update it as necessary.\nIt is also your responsibility to ensure that you are receiving the rewards to which you are entitled.\nPayPal is not responsible for managing your loyalty card account by offering this service and any questions about your loyalty card or associated rewards program should be directed to the seller who offers the card.</p> PayPal\u2019s Purchase Protection Program <p>When you buy something from a seller who accepts PayPal, you may be eligible for a refund under PayPal\u2019s Purchase Protection program.\nWhen applicable, PayPal\u2019s Purchase Protection program entitles you to reimbursement for the full purchase price of the item plus the original shipping costs you paid, if any.\nPayPal determines, in its sole discretion, whether your claim qualifies for the Purchase Protection program.\nPayPal\u2019s original determination is considered final, but you may be able to file an appeal of the decision with PayPal if you have new or compelling information not available at the time of the original determination or you believe there was an error in the decision-making process.</p>\n<p>IMPORTANT: You may be required to return the item to the seller or other party we specify as part of the settlement of your claim.\nPayPal\u2019s Purchase Protection program does not entitle you to reimbursement for the return shipping costs that you may incur.</p>\n<p>PayPal\u2019s Purchase Protection program may apply when you encounter these specific problems with a transaction:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>You didn\u2019t receive your item from a seller (referred to as an \u201cItem Not Received\u201d claim), or</li>\n<li>You received an item, but the item isn\u2019t what you ordered (referred to as a \u201cSignificantly Not as Described\u201d claim).</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If you believe that a transaction made through your PayPal account was not authorized by you, this type of claim is different from the Purchase Protection program, and is described below under Liability for Unauthorized Transactions and Other Errors.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p> QR Code Transactions <p>If you buy something from a seller in person by using a PayPal goods and services QR code, your transaction may be eligible for PayPal\u2019s Purchase Protection program.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p> Item Not Received claims <p>Your claim <strong>\n<em>will not</em>\n</strong> qualify for a refund under PayPal\u2019s Purchase Protection program for an Item Not Received claim, if:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>You collect the item in person, or arrange for it to be collected on your behalf, including if you use PayPal in a seller\u2019s physical store, except for in-person PayPal QR code goods and services transactions, or</li>\n<li>The seller has provided proof of shipment or proof of delivery.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If the seller presents evidence that they delivered the goods to you, PayPal may find in favor of the seller for an Item Not Received claim even if you claim you did not receive the goods.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p> Significantly Not as Described claims <p>An item may be considered Significantly Not as Described if:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The item is materially different from the seller\u2019s description of it.</li>\n<li>You received a completely different item.</li>\n<li>The condition of the item was misrepresented.\nFor example, the item was described as \u201cnew\u201d but the item was used.</li>\n<li>The item was advertised as authentic but is not authentic (i.e.\ncounterfeit).</li>\n<li>The item is missing major parts or features and those facts were not disclosed in the description of the item when you bought it.</li>\n<li>You purchased a certain number of items but didn\u2019t receive them all.</li>\n<li>The item was damaged during shipment.</li>\n<li>The item is unusable in its received state and was not disclosed as such.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>An item may not be considered Significantly Not as Described if:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The defect in the item was correctly described by the seller in its description of the item.</li>\n<li>The item was properly described but you didn't want it after you received it.</li>\n<li>The item was properly described but did not meet your expectations.</li>\n<li>The item has minor scratches and was described as \u201cused.\"</li>\n</ul>\n<p>&nbsp;</p> Ineligible items and transactions under PayPal\u2019s Purchase Protection program <p>Payments for the following are not eligible for reimbursement under PayPal Purchase Protection:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Real estate, including residential property.</li>\n<li>Financial products or investments of any kind.</li>\n<li>Businesses (when you buy or invest in a business).</li>\n<li>Vehicles, including, but not limited to, motor vehicles, motorcycles, recreational vehicles, aircraft and boats.</li>\n<li>Significantly Not as Described claims for wholly or

(i.e.\nnot sent using your PayPal account).</li>\n<li>Items intended for resale, including single item transactions or transactions that include multiple items.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>&nbsp;</p> Transaction eligibility for PayPal\u2019s Purchase Protection program <p>To be eligible for PayPal Purchase Protection you must meet all of the following requirements:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Have a PayPal account in good standing.</li>\n<li>Pay for the eligible item from your PayPal account.</li>\n<li>Attempt to contact the seller to resolve your issue directly before filing a claim through the Resolution Center.</li>\n<li>Respond to PayPal's request for documentation and other information within the time requested.</li>\n<li>Open a dispute in the Resolution Center within 180 days of the date you sent the payment and follow our online dispute resolution process.</li>\n<li>Not have received a recovery or agreed to an alternative resolution related to your purchase from another source.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>&nbsp;</p> Our online dispute resolution process <p>If you\u2019re unable to resolve a transaction related issue directly with a seller, you must follow our online dispute resolution process through the <strong>Resolution Center</strong> to pursue a claim under our Purchase Protection program.\nYou may also file a claim (Step 2 below) by calling us and speaking to an agent.\nThe steps you must follow are described below, and if you do not follow these steps your claim may be denied:</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>Step 1: <strong>Open a dispute</strong> within 180 days of the date you made the payment.\nThis might allow you to start a direct conversation with the seller regarding your issue with the transaction that may help resolve the dispute.\nIf you are unable to resolve the dispute directly with the seller, proceed to Step 2.\nWe will place a hold on all funds related to the transaction in the seller's PayPal account until the dispute is resolved or closed.</p>\n<p>Step 2: <strong>Escalate the dispute to a claim</strong> for reimbursement within 20 days after opening the dispute, if you and the seller are unable to come to an agreement, or we will automatically close the dispute.\nYou can escalate the dispute to a claim for reimbursement through the <strong>Resolution Center</strong>.\nThe seller or PayPal may also escalate the dispute to a claim at this point.\nPayPal may ask you to wait at least 7 days from the transaction date to escalate the dispute.\n</p>\n<p>Step 3: <strong>Respond to PayPal\u2019s requests for documentation or other information</strong>, after you, the seller or PayPal escalates your dispute to a claim for reimbursement.\nPayPal may require you to provide receipts, third party evaluations, police reports or other documents that PayPal specifies.\nYou must respond to these requests in a timely manner as requested in our correspondence with you.</p>\n<p>Step 4: <strong>Comply with PayPal\u2019s shipping requests in a timely manner</strong>, if you\u2019re filing a Significantly Not as Described claim.\nPayPal may require you, at your expense, to ship the item back to the seller, to PayPal or to a third party (which will be specified by PayPal) and to provide proof of delivery.</p>\n<p>Proof of delivery means:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>For transactions that total less than $750 U.S.\ndollars (or the currency threshold in the table below), confirmation that can be viewed online and includes the delivery address showing at least city/state or zip code, delivery date, and the identity of the shipping company you used.</li>\n<li>For transactions that total $750 U.S.\ndollar (or the currency threshold in the table below) or more, you must provide signature confirmation of delivery.\nIf the transaction is in a currency not listed in the table, then signature confirmation is required when the payment exceeds the equivalent of $750 USD at the PayPal exchange rate that applies at the time the transaction is processed.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n</p> Signature confirmation currency thresholds <p>\n<strong>Currency</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Transaction

final decision </strong>(including automatically closing any dispute or claim), in its sole discretion, based on the coverage and eligibility requirements set forth above, any additional information provided during the online dispute resolution process or any other information PayPal deems relevant and appropriate under the circumstances.</p>\n<p>Note that when you are making Digital Goods Micropayments Purchases, there are special rules that apply and that include pre-determined thresholds where we may, at our discretion, reverse the transaction without requiring you to take further action.\nWe may limit the number of automatic reversals that you benefit from, but, even if that is the case, you will still be able to follow PayPal's standard dispute resolution processes described above.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p> Dispute with us or your card issuer <p>If you used a debit or credit card as the payment method for a transaction through your PayPal account and you are dissatisfied with the transaction, you may be entitled to dispute the transaction with your card issuer.\nApplicable card chargeback rights may be broader than those available to you under PayPal\u2019s Purchase Protection program.\nFor example, if you dispute a transaction with your card issuer, you may be able to recover amounts you paid for unsatisfactory items even if they don\u2019t qualify for protection under a Significantly Not as Described claim with us.</p>\n<p>You must choose whether to pursue a dispute with PayPal under our Purchase Protection program, or to pursue the dispute with your card issuer.\nYou can\u2019t do both at the same time or seek a double recovery.\nIf you pursue a dispute/claim with us and you also pursue a dispute for the same transaction with your card issuer, we\u2019ll close your dispute/claim with us.\nThis won\u2019t affect the dispute process with your card issuer.\nIn addition, if you pursue a dispute with your card issuer, you cannot pursue a dispute/claim with us later.</p>\n<p>If you choose to dispute a transaction with PayPal and we decide against you, you can seek to pursue the dispute with your card issuer later.\nIf PayPal does not make a final decision on your claim until after your card issuer's deadline for filing a dispute, and because of our delay you recover less than the full amount you would have been entitled to recover from the card issuer, we will reimburse you for the remainder of your loss (minus any amount you have already recovered from the seller or your card issuer).</p>\n<p>Before contacting your card issuer or filing a dispute with PayPal, you should contact the seller to attempt to resolve your issue in accordance with the seller\u2019s return policy.</p> Selling and Accepting Payments Accepting Payments From Buyers for Goods and Services <p>&nbsp;</p> Receiving personal payments <p>If you use your PayPal account to receive payments for the sale of goods or services or accept donations, you must:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Pay any applicable fees for receiving the funds.</li>\n<li>Not ask your buyer to send you money using the \u201csend money to a friend or family member.\u201d If you do so, PayPal may remove your PayPal account\u2019s ability to accept payments from friends or family members.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>By integrating into your online checkout/platform any functionality intended to enable a payer without a PayPal account to send a payment to your PayPal account, you agree to all further terms of use of that functionality which PayPal will make available to you on any page on the PayPal or Braintree website (including any page for developers and our Legal Agreements page) or online platform.\nSuch further terms include the PayPal Alternative Payment Methods Agreement.\n</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p> No surcharges <p>You agree that you will not impose a surcharge or any other fee for accepting PayPal as a payment method.\nYou may charge a handling fee in connection with the sale of goods or services as long as the handling fee does not operate as a surcharge and is not higher than the handling fee you charge for non-PayPal transactions.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p> Presentation of PayPal and Pay with Venmo <p>You must treat PayPal and/or Venmo as payment methods or marks at least on par with any other payment methods offered at your points of sale where PayPal or Venmo branded services are integrated, including your websites or mobile applications.\nThis includes at least equal or better: logo placement, position within any point of sale, and treatment in terms of payment flow, terms, conditions, restrictions, and fees, in each case as compared to other marks and payment methods at your points of sale.\nFurther, you must not present any payment method or mark upstream (or at an earlier point in the checkout experience) from the presentment of any of PayPal or Venmo services or marks.\n</p>\n<p>In representations to your customers or in public communications, you must not mischaracterize any PayPal or Venmo services or exhibit a preference for other payment methods over PayPal or Venmo services.\nWithin all of your points of sale, you agree not to try to dissuade or inhibit your customers from using PayPal or Venmo services or encourage the customer to use an alternate payment method.\nIf you enable your customers to pay you with PayPal or Venmo, whenever you display or exhibit the payment methods that you accept (either within any point of sale or in your marketing materials, advertising, and other customer communications) you agree to display the PayPal or Venmo services payment marks at least as prominently, and in at least as positive a manner, as you do for all other payment methods.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p> Taxes and information reporting <p>Our fees do not include any taxes, levies, duties or similar governmental assessments of any nature, including, for example, value-added, sales, use or withholding taxes, assessable by any jurisdiction (collectively, \u201ctaxes\u201d).\nIt is your responsibility to determine what, if any, taxes apply to the payments you make or receive, and it is solely your responsibility to assess, collect, report and remit the correct taxes to the appropriate authority.\nPayPal is not responsible for determining whether any taxes apply to your transaction, or for calculating, collecting, reporting or remitting taxes arising from any transaction.</p>\n<p>You acknowledge that we may make certain reports to tax authorities regarding transactions that we process.\nFor example, PayPal is required to report to the Internal Revenue Service the total amount of payments for goods and services you receive each calendar year into all of your PayPal accounts associated with the same tax identification number if you receive more than $20,000 in payments for good and services and process more than 200 transactions involving goods or services through those PayPal accounts in the same calendar year.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p> Your customer service information, refunds and returns policy, and privacy policy <p>You must publish customer service information with clear instructions on how your customers can contact you.\nSuch instructions must include at least: (1) one active customer service email address or active customer service URL to file tickets for assistance and/or (2) one active customer service telephone number.\nSuch information must be readily accessible for review by your customers.</p>\n<p>You must publish a refunds and returns policy.</p>\n<p>You must publish a privacy policy, where required by law.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p> Payment review <p>PayPal reviews certain potentially high-risk transactions.\nIf PayPal determines, in its sole discretion, that a transaction is high-risk, we place a hold on the payment and provide notice to you to delay shipping of the item.\nPayPal will conduct a review and either complete or cancel the payment.\nIf the payment is completed, PayPal will provide notice to you to ship the item.\nOtherwise, PayPal will cancel the payment and the funds will be returned to the buyer, unless we are legally required to take other action.\nAll payments that complete this payment review will be eligible for PayPal's Seller Protection coverage if they meet the PayPal's Seller Protection requirements.\nWe will notify you about payment reviews by email and/or through your PayPal account.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p> In-store payments and QR code transactions <p>If you accept PayPal payments at your physical store, you must communicate the total amount of the transaction to the customer before it takes place.\nYou may charge your customer\u2019s account only for transactions that they have authorized.\nYou must also provide customers with a physical receipt if they request one.\nYou agree that any transaction that you make shall have an accurate and true description of the goods and services being purchased.</p>\n<p>If you use a QR code to accept payments in your physical store, you must use a QR code intended for goods and services transactions.\nYou must also not use QR codes intended for in-person transactions as a method of accepting payment for goods and services transactions occurring online.\nFor any buyer claims related to QR code transactions, you may be required to provide us with alternative evidence of delivery or such additional documentation or information relating to the transaction.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p> Marketplace sellers <p>If you\u2019re a seller on a marketplace or through a third party application where PayPal is offered, you must comply with any rules that apply to the marketplace\u2019s or the third party application\u2019s buyer protection program for sales you make through that forum.\nAny such protections may require you to take certain actions and may impact how claims are processed.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p> PayPal Giving Fund <p>If you are a charity and hold a PayPal account, you may be eligible to participate in PayPal Giving Fund programs.\nPayPal Giving Fund is a Donor Advised Fund (DAF) recognized by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) under Section 501(c)(3) of the Code as a tax-exempt public charity (Federal Tax ID: 45-0931286).\nIf you meet the eligibility requirements in the <strong>Nonprofit Certification Policy</strong> and are either a \u201cPublic Charity\u201d under Section 509(a) of the Code or a \"Private Operating Foundation\" under IRS regulations, you may be automatically enrolled with PayPal Giving Fund upon acceptance of this user agreement.\nYou will receive an email from us confirming your enrollment.\nYour relationship with PayPal Giving Fund will be governed by the <strong>Nonprofit User Agreement</strong>, including receiving email communications from PayPal Giving Fund about its current and future partners about its programs.\nYou can opt out of email communications at any time in your <strong>PayPal Giving Fund profile</strong>.\nIf you don\u2019t want to be enrolled or receive donations from PayPal Giving Fund, you can opt-out at any time by <strong>contacting us</strong>.\nFor more information, please see <strong>PayPal Giving Fund\u2019s Policies</strong>.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p> Card not present transactions <p>Whenever a buyer uses a debit or credit card as the payment method for a transaction using their account to buy something from you as a seller, the transaction will be processed as a \u201ccard not present\u201d transaction, even if the buyer is at your store location.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p> Accepting preauthorized payments <p>As a seller, you can accept payments from a buyer\u2019s account through preauthorized transfers either on a one-time, regular or sporadic basis.\nThis type of transaction is sometimes called a \u201cbilling agreement,\u201d \"subscription,\" \"recurring payment,\u201d \u201creference transaction,\u201d \"pre-approved payment \" or \"automatic payment.\"</p> If you receive preauthorized payments from buyers: <p>You must:</p>\n<p>You must not:</p>\n<p>Get each buyer\u2019s prior authorization for the amount, frequency, and duration of any such payment.</p>\n<p>Restart future payments without the buyer\u2019s written authorization, if a buyer has stopped or canceled a preauthorized payment.</p>\n<p>Provide a simple and easily accessible online cancelation procedure, if buyers sign up for preauthorized payments online.</p>\n<p>Provide buyers the ability to stop any such payment up to 3 Business Days before the date scheduled for payment.</p>\n<p>Notify the buyer at least 10 days in advance of the amount and date of each preauthorized payment if the preauthorized payment will vary from the preauthorized amount or (at the buyer\u2019s option) any payment that is in an amount that falls outside of the pre-determined range.</p> Transaction Fees for Online and In-Store Payments <p>Your PayPal transaction fees depend on:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>the country of the buyer\u2019s account or the currency of their card;</li>\n<li>whether you are registered as a charitable organization and have active 501(c)(3) status.\nYour 501(c)(3) status must be documented with PayPal to receive the rates applicable to charitable organizations, and those rates will apply only after you document your status with us.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>&nbsp;</p> Standard transaction fees <p>The fees you pay when selling goods or services and the buyer pays using their PayPal account (or using another authorized wallet) can be found on the Standard Transaction Fees table, with the fees applicable to charitable organizations founds on the Standard Transaction Fees for Charitable Organizations table for the charitable fees.\nPlease note that:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>We may adjust the fees applicable to future transactions that you process using PayPal.\nWe will provide you at least 21 days\u2019 advance notice for personal PayPal accounts and at least 5 days\u2019 advance notice for business PayPal accounts of any fee increase or the introduction of a new type of fee.</li>\n<li>If you refund a transaction to a buyer or a donation to a donor, there are no fees to make the refund, but the fees you originally paid as the seller are not returned.</li>\n<li>If you accept payments using a PayPal product (like PayPal Here or PayPal Payments Pro), the fees applicable to those products will apply to your transactions.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>&nbsp;</p> Micropayments fees <p>You may qualify to receive micropayments pricing for the sale of goods and services through your PayPal account, if your transactions typically average less than $10.\nIn order to qualify, you must have a PayPal account that is in good standing (for example, no limitations or negative balance), you may not be processing payments using PayPal Payments Pro and you must submit an application and have it approved by us.</p>\n<p>If your PayPal account is approved to accept micropayments, then the fees found on the Micropayment Fees table will apply to all transactions for the sale of goods or services processed through your PayPal account, instead of Standard Transaction Fees.\nIf you have multiple PayPal accounts, you must route your micropayments transactions through the appropriate account.\nOnce a transaction is processed, PayPal will not re-route the transaction through a different account.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p> PayPal Payouts and Mass Pay fees <p>PayPal\u2019s Payouts and Mass Pay services let you send multiple payments in one batch to send commissions, rebates, rewards, and general payments.\nYou may be able to choose to send payments to PayPal accounts, Venmo accounts, or both.\nIn order to use these services, you must have:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>a business PayPal account in good standing and with no withdrawal limits.\nand</li>\n<li>applied for and received our permission to use these services.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>We may remove your ability to use Payouts or Mass Pay at any time if there is a higher than acceptable level of risk associated with your use of those services.</p>\n<p>The amount you will pay us for these services differs according to whether you use the Payouts service or Mass Pay service, how you send the payments, and the currency of the payment.\nThese fees can be found in the PayPal Payouts and Mass Pay Fees table.</p>\n<p>You can send money through Payouts or Mass Pay even if your receiver does not have a PayPal or Venmo account, as applicable, using their email address or mobile number.\nIf the person to whom you are sending money does not have a relevant account, they can claim it by opening one.\nIf they don\u2019t claim it, it will be refunded to you in thirty (30) days.\nPayPal is not liable for amounts sent by you in error.\nPayPal shall have no responsibility to reverse any payout payment.\n</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p> Your responsibility to notify PayPal of pricing or fee errors <p>Once you have access to any account statement(s) or other account activity information made available to you by PayPal with respect to your business account(s), you will have ninety (90) days to notify PayPal in writing of any errors or discrepancies with respect to the pricing or other fees applied by PayPal.\nIf you do not notify PayPal within such timeframe, you accept such information as accurate, and PayPal shall have no obligation to make any corrections.\nFor the purposes of this provision, such pricing or fee errors or discrepancies are different than Unauthorized Transactions and other electronic transfer<strong> Errors</strong> which are each subject to different notification timeframes as set forth herein.</p> Refunds, Reversals and Chargebacks <p>&nbsp;</p> General information <p>If you receive a payment for selling goods or services that is later refunded or invalidated for any reason, you are responsible for the full amount of the payment sent to you plus any fees (including any applicable chargeback fee or Dispute fee).\nWhenever a transaction is refunded or otherwise reversed, PayPal will refund or reverse the transaction from your PayPal account.\nIf a currency conversion is necessary (for example if the balance in your Cash Account or your business PayPal account for a particular currency is insufficient to cover the amount of a refund or reversal, or if the buyer paid in a different currency), PayPal will perform a currency conversion in order to refund or reverse the transaction.\nPayPal\u2019s transaction exchange rate (including our currency conversion spread) at the time the refund or reversal is processed will be used.</p>\n<p>If you refund a payment for goods or services, there are no fees to make the refund, but the fees you originally paid as the seller are not returned to you.\nThe amount of the refunded payment will be deducted from your PayPal account.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p> Payments that are invalidated and reversed <p>Payments to you may be invalidated and reversed by PayPal if:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>You lose a PayPal Purchase Protection claim submitted to us by a buyer, including as a result of your failure to respond in a timely manner.</li>\n<li>You lose a Venmo Protected Purchase Program claim.</li>\n<li>Your buyer pursues a chargeback related to a card-funded transaction and the transaction is not eligible for PayPal's Seller Protection.\nThe card issuer, not PayPal, determines whether a buyer is successful when they pursue a chargeback related to a card-funded transaction.</li>\n<li>You do not fulfill the transaction as promised or you cannot provide proof of shipment or proof of delivery when required.</li>\n<li>eBay decides against you under its money back guarantee program (and you haven\u2019t opted out).</li>\n<li>Our investigation of a bank reversal made by a buyer or the buyer\u2019s bank finds that the transaction was fraudulent.</li>\n<li>PayPal sent the payment to you in error.</li>\n<li>The payment was unauthorized</li>\n<li>You received the payment for activities that violated this user agreement or any other agreement between you and PayPal.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>When you receive a payment, you are liable to PayPal for the full amount of the payment sent to you plus any fees if the payment is later invalidated or reversed for any reason.\nIf the buyer paid in another currency, the full amount of that payment may be calculated in that currency, using the PayPal transaction exchange rate (including our currency conversion spread) that applies at the time the refund or reversal is processed.\nIf the balance in your Cash Account or business PayPal account doesn\u2019t cover the payment amount due plus the fees, we may use any of the payment methods linked to your PayPal account to cover the amount due.\nIf the payment methods linked to your PayPal account don\u2019t cover the amount due, this will result in a negative balance.\nA negative balance represents an amount that you owe to us, and, in this situation, you must immediately add funds to your balance to resolve it.\nIf you don\u2019t, PayPal may:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>engage in collection efforts to recover the amount due from you;</li>\n<li>take any or all action as outlined under Amounts owed to PayPal.\nor</li>\n<li>place a limitation or take other action on your PayPal account as outlined under Restricted Activities and Holds.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>&nbsp;</p> Dispute fees <p>PayPal will charge a <strong>Dispute fee</strong> to sellers for facilitating the online dispute resolution process for transactions that are processed either through a buyer\u2019s PayPal account or through a PayPal guest checkout.\nThe <strong>Dispute fee</strong> applies when the buyer pursues a claim directly with PayPal, a chargeback with their card issuer, or a reversal with their bank.\nThe <strong>Dispute fee</strong> will be charged at either the <strong>Standard Dispute fee</strong> rate or the <strong>High Volume Dispute fee</strong> rate.\nThe <strong>Dispute fee</strong> will be charged in the currency which you selected for the original transaction listing.\nIf the transaction was in a currency not listed in the <strong>Dispute fee</strong> table, then the fee charged will be in your primary holding currency.\nThe <strong>Dispute fee</strong> will be deducted from your PayPal account after the claim is decided.</p>\n<p>The <strong>Dispute fee</strong> amount will be determined when the dispute case is created.\nThe fee is based on the ratio of the total transaction amount of your claims compared to the total amount of your sales for the previous three calendar months.\nFor example, for a dispute raised in September, your dispute ratio will be calculated by considering your total claims to sales ratio over June, July, and August.\nYour total claims include all claims filed directly with and escalated to PayPal, except claims for <strong>Unauthorized Transactions</strong>.\nand all chargebacks from the buyer\u2019s card issuer or reversals from the buyer\u2019s bank.</p>\n<p>If your dispute ratio is 1.5% or more and you had more than 100 sales transactions in the previous three full calendar months, you will be charged the <strong>High Volume Dispute fee</strong> for each dispute.\nOtherwise, you will be charged the <strong>Standard Dispute fee</strong> for each dispute.</p>\n<p>You will <strong>\n<u>not</u>\n</strong> be charged a <strong>Standard Dispute fee</strong> for disputes that are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Inquiries in PayPal\u2019s<strong> Resolution Center</strong> that are not escalated to a claim with PayPal.</li>\n<li>Resolved directly between you and the buyer and not escalated to a claim with PayPal.</li>\n<li>Filed by the buyer directly with PayPal as an <strong>Unauthorized Transaction</strong>.</li>\n<li>Eligible for <strong>PayPal\u2019s Seller Protection</strong> program.</li>\n<li>Claims with a transaction value that is less than twice the amount of a Standard Dispute fee.</li>\n<li>Decided in your favor by PayPal or your issuer.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>You will <strong>\n<u>not</u>\n</strong> be charged a <strong>High Volume Dispute fee</strong> for disputes that are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Inquiries in PayPal\u2019s<strong> Resolution Center</strong> and not escalated to a claim with PayPal.</li>\n<li>Resolved directly between you and the buyer and not escalated to a claim with PayPal.</li>\n<li>Filed by the buyer directly with PayPal as an <strong>Unauthorized Transaction</strong>.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Sellers charged <strong>High Volume Dispute fees</strong> may be required to provide a remediation plan which includes an explanation of the cause of the increased dispute rate, the actions taken to reduce disputes, and the timelines for those actions.</p>\n<p>Disputes listed above may be excluded from being charged a <strong>Standard Dispute fee</strong> or a <strong>High Volume Dispute fee</strong>, but the claim itself may still be included in the overall calculation of your dispute ratio.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p> Chargeback fees <p>For transactions that are not processed either through a buyer\u2019s PayPal account or through a guest checkout, and where the buyer pursues a chargeback for the transaction with their card issuer, then PayPal will charge you a <strong>Chargeback fee</strong> for facilitating the chargeback process.\nThis fee with apply regardless of whether the buyer is successful in pursuing the chargeback with the card issuer.</p> The applicable chargeback fee will be deducted from your PayPal account.\nThe chargeback fee is applied as specified in the Chargeback Fee table and will be charged in the currency which you selected for the original transaction listing.\nIf the transaction was in a currency not listed in the <strong>Chargeback fee</strong> table, the fee charged will be in your primary holding currency.\n<p>&nbsp;</p> Impact of various purchase protection processes on sellers <p>You should read and understand PayPal\u2019s Purchase Protection program, Venmo\u2019s Protected Purchase Program, and if you sell goods and services to buyers with PayPal accounts in countries other than your own, you also should be familiar with the purchase protection available to buyers in each of those countries.\nBuyers\u2019 rights under these programs may impact you as a seller.\nYou can find information about PayPal\u2019s protection programs on the Legal Agreements page by selecting your buyer\u2019s location at the top of the page and referring to the corresponding user agreement.\nYou can find information on Venmo\u2019s Protected Purchase Program in Venmo\u2019s user agreement.</p>\n<p>If you lose a claim under PayPal\u2019s Purchase Protection program in any country, or under Venmo\u2019s Protected Purchase Program:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>You must forfeit the full purchase price of the item plus the original shipping cost.\nIn some cases you may not receive the item back.</li>\n<li>You will not receive a refund of the PayPal fees that you paid in connection with the sale.</li>\n<li>If the claim was that the item received was Significantly Not as Described, you may not receive the item back, or you may be required to accept the item back and pay for the return shipping costs.</li>\n<li>If the claim was that the item received was Significantly Not as Described and related to an item you sold that is counterfeit, you will be required to provide a full refund to the buyer and you may not receive the item back.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If you accept PayPal payments from buyers for goods or services you sell through eBay, then you need to read and understand the eBay Money Back Guarantee program.\nUnless you opt out by calling eBay, PayPal will treat eBay\u2019s decisions in favor of your buyers under that program as a basis for reversing a PayPal payment made to you.\nIf the balance in your Cash Account or business PayPal account is insufficient to cover the amount, we may:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>place a hold on your PayPal account until sufficient funds become available in your PayPal account to cover the amount.\nor</li>\n<li>create a negative balance in your PayPal account.</li>\n</ul> PayPal's Seller Protection Program <p>&nbsp;</p> What\u2019s eligible <p>If you sell something to a buyer and the transaction is later disputed or reversed under Reversals, Claims or Chargebacks, you may be eligible for reimbursement under PayPal\u2019s Seller Protection program.\nWhen it applies, PayPal\u2019s Seller Protection program entitles you to retain the full purchase amount for debit and credit card-funded transactions.\nThere is no limit on the number of payments for which you can receive coverage.\nBy accessing the transaction details page in your PayPal account you can determine whether or not your transaction is eligible for protection under this program.</p>\n<p>PayPal\u2019s Seller Protection program may apply when a buyer claims that:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>They did not authorize, or benefit from, funds sent from their PayPal account (referred to as an \u201cUnauthorized Transaction\u201d claim), and the Unauthorized Transaction occurs in an environment hosted by Paypal.\nor</li>\n<li>They didn\u2019t receive the item from you (referred to as an \u201cItem Not Received\u201d claim).</li>\n</ul>\n<p>PayPal\u2019s Seller Protection program may also apply when a transaction is reversed because of a successful chargeback by a buyer or when a bank funded payment is reversed by the buyer\u2019s bank.</p>\n<p>This section describes PayPal\u2019s Seller Protection program as it applies to you, but you should also be familiar with the Impact of various purchase protection processes on sellers.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p> Basic requirements <p>To be eligible for PayPal\u2019s Seller Protection, all of the following basic

arranged by the buyer, so that you will be able to provide valid proof of shipping and delivery.\n<ul>\n<li>The shipping requirement does not apply to eligible transactions involving items that you deliver in person.\nprovided, however, that you agree to provide us with alternative evidence of delivery or such additional documentation or information relating to the transaction that we may request.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>You must respond to PayPal's requests for documentation and other information in a timely manner as requested in our email correspondence with you or in our

Protection.</li>\n<li>If the sale involves pre-ordered or made-to-order goods, you must ship within the timeframe you specified in the listing.\nOtherwise, it is recommended that you ship all items within 7 days after receipt of payment.</li>\n<li>Provide proof of shipment or delivery.</li>\n<li>The payment must be marked \u201celigible\u201d or \u201cpartially eligible\u201d in the case of

amount of the payment (including shipping and taxes) is in a currency not listed in the table, then signature confirmation is required when the payment exceeds the equivalent of $750 USD at the PayPal exchange rate that applies at the time the transaction is processed.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>&nbsp;</p> Establishing proof of delivery or proof of shipment <p>\n<strong>Physical Goods</strong>\n</p> The following is required as proof of shipment or delivery for physical goods: <p>Proof of shipment</p>\n<p>Proof of delivery</p>\n<p>Online or physical documentation from a shipping company that

Protection claim may be denied.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Intangible Goods</strong>\n</p> The following is required as proof of shipment or delivery for intangible goods: <p>\n<strong>QR Code Transactions</strong>\n</p> The following is required as proof of shipment or proof of delivery: <p>For intangible or digital goods, proof of shipment or delivery means compelling evidence to show the

damages considering all currently existing circumstances, including the relationship of the sum to the range of harm to PayPal that reasonably could be anticipated because, due to the nature of the violations of the Acceptable Use Policy, actual damages would be impractical or extremely difficult to calculate.\nPayPal may deduct such damages directly from any existing balance in any PayPal account you control.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If we close your PayPal account or terminate your use of the PayPal services for any reason, we\u2019ll provide you with notice of our actions and make any

Holds, Limitations, and Reserves <p>&nbsp;</p> What are holds, limitations and reserves <p>Under certain circumstances, in order to protect PayPal and the security and integrity of the network of buyers and sellers that use the PayPal services, PayPal may take account-level or transaction-level actions.\nUnless otherwise noted, if we take any of the actions described here, we\u2019ll provide you with notice of our actions, but we retain the sole discretion to take these actions.\nTo request information in connection with an account limitation, hold or reserve, you should visit the Resolution Center or follow the instructions in our email notice with respect to the limitation, hold or reserve.</p>\n<p>Our decision about holds, limitations and reserves may be based on confidential criteria that are essential to our management of risk and the protection of PayPal, our customers and/or service providers.\nWe may use proprietary fraud and risk modeling when assessing the risk associated with your PayPal account.\nIn addition, we may be restricted by regulation or a governmental authority from disclosing certain information to you about such decisions.\nWe have no obligation to disclose the details of our risk management or security procedures to you.</p>\n<p>In order to facilitate PayPal\u2019s actions described above and allow us to assess the level of risk associated with your PayPal account, you agree to cooperate with PayPal\u2019s reasonable requests for financial statements and other documentation or information in a timely fashion.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p> Holds <p>A hold is an action that PayPal may take under certain circumstances either at the transaction level or the account level.\nWhen PayPal places a temporary hold on a payment, the money is not available to either the sender or the recipient.\nPayPal reviews many factors before placing a hold on a payment, including: account tenure, transaction activity, business type, past customer disputes, and overall customer satisfaction.\nSome common situations where PayPal will hold payments include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>New sellers or sellers who have limited selling activity.</li>\n<li>Payments for higher-risk categories like electronics or tickets.</li>\n<li>Sellers who have performance issues, or a high rate of buyer dissatisfaction or disputes.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n<strong>Holds based on PayPal\u2019s risk decisions</strong>\n</p>\n<p>We may place a hold on payments sent to your PayPal account if, in our sole discretion, we believe that there may be a high level of risk associated with you, your PayPal account, or your transactions or that placing such a hold is necessary to comply with state or federal regulatory requirements.\nWe make decisions about whether to place a payment hold based on a number of factors, including information available to us from both internal sources and third parties.\nWhen we place a hold on a payment, the funds will appear in your PayPal account with an indication that they are unavailable or pending.\nWe\u2019ll notify you, either through your PayPal account or directly by phone or email, whenever we place a hold.</p>\n<p>Risk-based holds generally remain in place for up to 21 days from the date the payment was received into your PayPal account.\nWe may release the hold earlier under certain circumstances (for example, if you\u2019ve uploaded shipment tracking information related to the transaction), but any earlier release is at our sole discretion.\nThe hold may last longer than 21 days if the payment is challenged as a payment that should be invalidated and reversed based on a disputed transaction as discussed in the following paragraph below.\nIn this case, we\u2019ll hold the payment in your PayPal account until the matter is resolved (but no longer than 180 days).</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Holds related to Marketplace transactions</strong>\n</p>\n<p>If you\u2019re a seller on a marketplace or through a third-party application where PayPal is offered, a hold may be placed on a payment sent to you at the instruction of the applicable marketplace or third party.\nThis is done once you have granted us permission to have your funds held and will be in accordance with your agreement with the third party.\nThese holds will appear in your PayPal account.\nIf you have questions about why the applicable marketplace or third party instructed PayPal to put these holds in place, you will need to contact the marketplace or third party directly.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Holds based on disputed transactions</strong>\n</p>\n<p>If a payment sent to you as a seller is challenged as a payment that should be invalidated and reversed, we may place a temporary hold on the funds in your PayPal account to cover the amount that could be reversed.\nAny of the situations described under Refunds, Reversals and Chargebacks are situations that could result in us placing a hold on a payment.\nIf we determine the transaction should not be reversed, we\u2019ll lift the temporary hold.\nIf we determine the transaction should be reversed, we\u2019ll remove the funds from your PayPal account.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p> Account Limitations <p>Limitations are implemented to help protect PayPal, buyers and sellers when we notice restricted activities, an increased financial risk, or activity that appears to us as unusual or suspicious.\nLimitations also help us collect information necessary for keeping your PayPal account open.</p>\n<p>There are several reasons why your PayPal account could be limited, including:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>If we suspect someone could be using your PayPal account without your knowledge, we\u2019ll limit it for your protection and look into the fraudulent activity.</li>\n<li>If your debit or credit card issuer alerts us that someone has used your card without your permission.\nSimilarly, if your bank lets us know that there have been unauthorized transfers between your PayPal account and your bank account.</li>\n<li>In order to comply with applicable law.</li>\n<li>If we reasonably believe you have breached this agreement or violated the Acceptable Use Policy.</li>\n<li>Seller performance indicating your PayPal account is high risk.\nExamples include: indications of poor selling performance because you\u2019ve received an unusually high number of claims and chargebacks, selling an entirely new or high-cost product type, or if your typical sales volume increases rapidly.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>You will need to resolve any issues with your account before a limitation can be removed.\nNormally, this is done after you provide us with the information we request.\nHowever, if we reasonably believe a risk still exists after you have provided us that information, we may take action to protect PayPal, our users, a third party, or you from reversals, fees, fines, penalties, legal and/or regulatory risks and any other liability.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p> Reserves placed on business PayPal accounts <p>We may place a reserve on your business PayPal account at any time if we believe there may be a high level of risk associated with you, your business PayPal account, your business model, or your transactions.\nWhen we place a reserve on your business PayPal account, it means that all or some portion of the money in your business PayPal account is reserved as unavailable for withdrawal in order to protect against the risk of transactions made by you being reversed or invalidated or any other risk related to your business PayPal account or use of the PayPal services.\nWe make decisions about whether to place a reserve based on a number of factors, including information available to us from both internal sources and from third parties.</p>\n<p>PayPal considers a list of non-exclusive factors and whether and how these factors have changed over time, including:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>How long you have been in business.</li>\n<li>Whether your industry has a higher likelihood of chargebacks.</li>\n<li>Your payment processing history with PayPal and other providers.</li>\n<li>Your business and/or personal credit history.</li>\n<li>Your delivery time frames.</li>\n<li>Whether you have higher than average number of returns, chargebacks, claims or disputes.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>There are two types of reserves that may be placed on your business PayPal account, and one or both may be applied at the same time:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>A Rolling reserve</strong> is a reserve where a percentage of each transaction you receive each day is held and then released later on a scheduled basis.\nFor example, your reserve could be set at 10% and held for a 90-day rolling period \u2013 meaning 10% of the money you receive on day 1 is held and then released on day 91, 10% of the money you receive on day 2 is held until day 92, etc.\nRolling reserves are the most common type of reserve.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>A Minimum reserve</strong> is a specific minimum amount of money that you\u2019re required to keep available in the balance of your business PayPal account at all times.\nThe minimum reserve is either taken as an upfront amount deposited all at once or is established on a rolling basis from percentages of sales until the minimum reserve is achieved, much like a rolling reserve.\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If we place a reserve on funds in your account, the funds will be shown as \"pending\" and we\u2019ll notify you of the terms of the reserve.<br> If we change the terms of the reserve due to a change in our risk assessment, we\u2019ll notify you of the new terms.<br>\n</p> Court Orders, Regulatory Requirements or Other Legal Process <p>If we are notified of a court order or other legal process (including garnishment or any equivalent process) affecting you, or if we otherwise believe we are required to do so in order to comply with applicable law or regulatory requirements, we may be required to take certain actions, including holding payments to/from your PayPal account, placing a reserve or limitation on your PayPal account, or releasing your funds.\nWe will decide, in our sole discretion, which action is required of us.\nUnless the court order, applicable law, regulatory requirement or other legal process requires otherwise, we will notify you of these actions.\nWe do not have an obligation to contest or appeal any court order or legal process involving you or your PayPal account.\nWhen we implement a hold, reserve or limitation as a result of a court order, applicable law, regulatory requirement or other legal process, the hold, reserve or limitation may remain in place longer than 180 days.</p> PayPal User Agreement Liability for Unauthorized Transactions and Other Errors Protection from Unauthorized Transactions <p>To protect yourself from unauthorized activity in your PayPal account, you should regularly log into your PayPal account and review your PayPal account statement.\nPayPal will notify you of each transaction by sending an email to your primary email address on file.\nYou should review these transaction notifications to ensure that each transaction was authorized and accurately completed.</p>\n<p>PayPal will protect you from unauthorized activity in your PayPal account.\nWhen this protection applies, PayPal will cover you for the full amount of the unauthorized activity as long as you cooperate with us and follow the procedures described below.\n</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p> What is an Unauthorized Transaction <p>An \u201cUnauthorized Transaction\u201d occurs when money is sent from your PayPal account that you did not authorize and that did not benefit you.\nFor example, if someone steals your password, uses the password to access your PayPal account, and sends a payment from your PayPal account, an Unauthorized Transaction has occurred.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p> What is not considered an Unauthorized Transaction <p>The following are NOT considered Unauthorized Transactions:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>If you give someone access to your PayPal account (by giving them your login information) and they use your PayPal account without your knowledge or permission.\nYou are responsible for transactions made in this situation.</li>\n<li>Invalidation and reversal of a payment as a result of the actions described under Refunds, Reversals and Chargebacks.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>&nbsp;</p> Reporting an Unauthorized Transaction <p>If you believe your PayPal login information has been lost or stolen, please contact PayPal customer service immediately or call: (888) 221-1161 or write: PayPal, Attn: Error Resolution Department, P.O.\nBox 45950, Omaha, NE 68145-0950.</p>\n<p>Tell us AT ONCE if you believe that an electronic fund transfer has been made without your permission using your login information or by other means.\nYou could lose all the money in your PayPal account.\nIf you tell us within 60 days after we provide you your PayPal account statement showing transfers you did not make, you will be eligible for 100% protection for Unauthorized Transactions.</p>\n<p>Also, if your PayPal account statement shows transfers that you did not make, including those made with your PayPal login information or by other means, tell us at once.\nIf you do not tell us within 60 days after we provided the statement to you, you may not get back any money you lost after the 60 days if we can prove that we could have stopped someone from taking the money if you had told us in time.\nIf a good reason (such as a long trip or a hospital stay) kept you from telling us, we may extend the time periods.</p> Error Resolution <p>&nbsp;</p> What is an Error <p>An \u201cError\u201d means the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>When money is either incorrectly taken from your PayPal account or incorrectly placed into your PayPal account, or when a transaction is incorrectly recorded in your PayPal account.</li>\n<li>You send a payment and the incorrect amount is debited from your PayPal account.</li>\n<li>An incorrect amount is credited to your PayPal account.</li>\n<li>A transaction is missing from or not properly identified in your PayPal account statement.</li>\n<li>We make a

information concerning preauthorized (recurring) transfers to your PayPal account that PayPal is required to provide to you.</li>\n<li>You request additional information or clarification concerning a transfer to or from your PayPal account, including a request you make to determine whether an error has occurred.</li>\n<li>You inquire about the status of a pending transfer to or from your PayPal account.</li>\n<li>You request documentation or other information, unless the request is for a duplicate copy for tax or other record-keeping purposes.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>&nbsp;</p> What is not considered an Error <p>The following are NOT considered Errors:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>If you give someone access to your PayPal account (by giving them your login information) and they use your PayPal account without your knowledge or permission.\nYou are responsible for transactions made in this situation.</li>\n<li>Invalidation and reversal of a payment as a result of the actions described under Refunds, Reversals and Chargebacks.</li>\n<li>Routine inquiries about the balance in your Cash Account or business PayPal account, or any money waiting to be claimed through your personal PayPal account if you do not have a Cash Account linked to your personal PayPal account.</li>\n<li>Requests for duplicate documentation or other information for tax or other recordkeeping purposes.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>&nbsp;</p> In case of Errors or questions about your electronic transfers <p>Telephone us at (888) 221-1161, contact us through the PayPal Resolution Center.\nor write us at PayPal, Attn: Error Resolution Department, P.O.\nBox 45950, Omaha, NE 68145-0950.\n</p>\n<p>Notify us as soon as you can, if you think your statement or receipt is wrong or if you need more information about a transfer listed on the statement or receipt.\nWe must hear from you no later than 60 days after we sent the FIRST statement on which the problem or error appeared.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Tell us your name and account number (if any).</li>\n<li>Describe the error or the transfer you are unsure about, and explain as clearly as you can why you believe it is an

writing within 10 Business Days.</p>\n<p>We will determine whether an error occurred within 10 Business Days after we hear from you and will correct any error promptly.\nIf we need more time, however, we may take up to 45 days to investigate your complaint or question.\nIf we decide to do this, we will credit your PayPal account within 10 Business Days for the amount you think is in error, so that you will have the use of the money during the time it takes us to complete our investigation.\nIf we ask you to put your complaint or question in writing and we do not receive it within 10 Business Days, we may not credit your PayPal account.</p>\n<p>For errors involving new PayPal accounts, point-of-sale transactions, or foreign-initiated transactions, we may take up to 90 days to investigate your complaint or question.\nFor new PayPal accounts, we may take up to 20 Business Days to credit your PayPal account for the amount you think is in error.</p>\n<p>We will tell you the results within 3 Business Days after completing our investigation.\nIf we decide that there was no error, we will send you a written explanation.\nYou may ask for copies of the documents that we used in our investigation.</p> Processing Errors <p>We will rectify any processing error that we discover.\nIf the error results in:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>You receiving less than the correct amount to which you were entitled, then we will credit your PayPal account for the difference between what you should have received and what you actually received.</li>\n<li>You receiving more than the correct amount to which you were entitled, then we will debit your PayPal account for the difference between what you actually received and what you should have received.</li>\n<li>Our not completing a transaction on time or in the correct amount, then we will be responsible to you for your losses or damages directly caused by this failure, unless: <ul>\n<li>through no fault of ours, you did not have enough available funds to complete the transaction;</li>\n<li>our system was not working properly and you knew about the breakdown when you started the transaction.\nor</li>\n<li>the error was due to extraordinary circumstances outside our control (such as fire, flood or loss of Internet connection), despite our reasonable precautions.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Processing errors are not:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Delays that result from PayPal applying holds, limitations or reserves.</li>\n<li>Delays based on a payment review.</li>\n<li>Delays described under How to buy something related to the time it may take for a purchase transaction to be completed in some situations.</li>\n<li>Your errors in making a transaction (for example, mistyping an amount of money that you are sending).</li>\n</ul> Remittance Transfer Errors <p>&nbsp;</p> What is a Remittance Transfer <p>You may be protected for certain errors when you send money using a PayPal account outside of the

total shown on the receipt was an estimate, and the difference results from application of the actual exchange rate, fees, and taxes).</li>\n<li>PayPal made a computational or bookkeeping error, such as a miscalculation of the amount the recipient received.</li>\n<li>The amount stated in the remittance transfer receipt was not made available to the recipient, unless: <ul>\n<li>we stated in the remittance transfer receipt that we used estimates and the difference in the amount received and the amount stated in the remittance transfer receipt results from application of the actual exchange rate, fees, and taxes, or</li>\n<li>the problem was caused by extraordinary circumstances outside our control.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Funds were available to the recipient later than the date of availability that was disclosed to you on the remittance transfer receipt or were not delivered, unless: <ul>\n<li>extraordinary circumstances outside our control caused the delay, and we could not

between you and PayPal, including without limitation federal and state statutory claims, common law claims, and those based in contract, tort, fraud, misrepresentation or any other legal theory, shall be resolved exclusively through final and binding arbitration, rather than in court, except that you may assert claims in small claims court, if your claims qualify and so long as the matter remains in such court and advances only on an individual (non-class, non-representative) basis.\nThis Agreement to Arbitrate is intended to be broadly interpreted.\nThe Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of this Agreement to Arbitrate.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>\n<em> Prohibition of Class and Representative Actions and Non-Individualized Relief</em>\n</strong>\n</p>\n<p>You and PayPal agree that each of us may bring claims against the other only on an individual basis and not as a plaintiff or class member in any purported class or representative action or proceeding.\nUnless both you and PayPal agree otherwise, the arbitrator(s) may not consolidate or join more than one person\u2019s or party\u2019s claims and may not otherwise preside over any form of a consolidated, representative or class proceeding.\nAlso, the arbitrator(s) may award relief (including monetary, injunctive and declaratory relief) only in favor of the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief necessitated by that party\u2019s individual claim(s).\nAny relief awarded cannot affect other PayPal customers.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>\n<em>Arbitration Procedures</em>\n</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Arbitration is more informal than a lawsuit in court.\nArbitration uses a neutral arbitrator or arbitrators instead of a judge or jury, and court review of an arbitration award is very limited.\nHowever, the arbitrator(s) can award the same damages and relief on an individual basis that a court can award to an individual.\nThe arbitrator(s) also must follow the terms of this user agreement as a court would.\nAll issues are for the arbitrator(s) to decide, except that issues relating to arbitrability, the scope or enforceability of this Agreement to Arbitrate, or the interpretation of the Prohibition of Class and Representative Actions and Non-Individualized Relief section above, shall be for a court of competent jurisdiction to decide.</p>\n<p>The arbitration will be conducted by the American Arbitration Association (referred to as the \"AAA\") under its rules and procedures, including the AAA's Consumer Arbitration Rules (as applicable), as modified by this Agreement to Arbitrate.\nThe AAA's rules are available at www.adr.org.\nA party who intends to seek arbitration must first send the other party, by certified mail, a completed Notice of Dispute.\nYou should send this notice to PayPal at: PayPal, Inc., Attn: Litigation Department, Re: Notice of Dispute, 2211 North First Street, San Jose, CA 95131.\nPayPal will send any notice to you to the address we have on file associated with your PayPal account.\nit is your responsibility to keep your address up to date.\nAll information called for in the notice must be provided including a description of the nature and basis of the claims the party is asserting and the relief sought.</p>\n<p>If you and PayPal are unable to resolve the claims described in the notice within 30 days after the notice is sent, you or PayPal may initiate arbitration proceedings.\nA form for initiating arbitration proceedings is available on the AAA's website at www.adr.org.</p>\n<p>The arbitration shall be held in the county in which you reside or at another mutually agreed location.\nIf the value of the relief sought is $10,000 or less, you or PayPal may elect to have the arbitration conducted by telephone or based solely on written submissions, which election shall be binding on you and PayPal subject to the discretion of the arbitrator(s) to require an in-person hearing, if the circumstances warrant.\nIn cases where an in-person hearing is held, you and/or PayPal may attend by telephone, unless the arbitrator(s) require otherwise.\nAny settlement offer made by you or PayPal shall not be disclosed to the arbitrator(s).</p>\n<p>The arbitrator(s) will decide the substance of all claims in accordance with applicable law, including recognized principles of equity, and will honor all claims of privilege recognized by law.\nThe arbitrator(s) shall not be bound by rulings in prior arbitrations involving different PayPal customers, but is/are bound by rulings in prior arbitrations involving the same PayPal customer to the extent required by applicable law.\nThe award of the arbitrator(s) shall be final and binding, and judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator(s) may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>\n<em>Costs of Arbitration</em>\n</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Payment of all filing, administration, and arbitrator fees will be governed by the AAA's rules, unless otherwise stated in this Agreement to Arbitrate.\nIf the value of the relief sought is $10,000 or less, at your request, PayPal will pay all filing, administration, and arbitrator fees associated with the arbitration.\nAny request for payment of fees by PayPal should be submitted by mail to the AAA along with your Demand for Arbitration and PayPal will make arrangements to pay all necessary fees directly to the AAA.\nIf the value of the relief sought is more than $10,000 and you are able to demonstrate that the costs of accessing arbitration will be prohibitive as compared to the costs of accessing a court for purposes of pursuing litigation on an individual basis, PayPal will pay as much of the filing, administration, and arbitrator fees as the arbitrator(s) deem necessary to prevent the cost of accessing the arbitration from being prohibitive.\nIn the event the arbitrator(s) determine the claim(s) you assert in the arbitration to be frivolous, you agree to reimburse PayPal for all fees associated with the arbitration paid by PayPal on your behalf that you otherwise would be obligated to pay under the AAA's rules.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>\n<em>Severability</em>\n</strong>\n</p>\n<p>With the exception of any of the provisions in the Prohibition of Class and Representative Actions and Non-Individualized Relief section above, if a court decides that any part of this Agreement to Arbitrate is invalid or unenforceable, the other parts of this Agreement to Arbitrate shall still apply.\nIf a court decides that any of the provisions in the Prohibition of Class and Representative Actions and Non-Individualized Relief section above is invalid or unenforceable because it would prevent the exercise of a non-waivable right to pursue public injunctive relief, then any dispute regarding the entitlement to such relief (and only that relief) must be severed from arbitration and may be litigated in court.\nAll other disputes subject to arbitration under the terms of the Agreement to Arbitrate shall be arbitrated under its terms.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>\n<em>Opt-Out Procedure</em>\n</strong>\n</p>\n<p>If you are a new PayPal customer, you can choose to reject this Agreement to Arbitrate by mailing us a written opt-out notice.\nThe opt-out notice must be postmarked no later than 30 days after the date you accept this user agreement for the first time.\nYou must mail the opt-out notice to PayPal, Inc., Attn: Litigation Department, 2211 North First Street, San Jose, CA 95131.</p>\n<p>For your convenience, we are providing an opt-out notice form you must complete and mail to opt out of this Agreement to Arbitrate.\nYou must complete this form by providing all the information it calls for, including your name, address, phone number, and the email address(es) used to log in to the PayPal account(s) to which the opt-out applies.\nYou must sign the opt-out notice for it to be effective.\nThis procedure is the only way you can opt out of the Agreement to Arbitrate.\nIf you opt out of this Agreement to Arbitrate, all other parts of the user agreement will continue to apply.\nOpting out of this Agreement to Arbitrate has no effect on any previous, other, or future arbitration agreements that you may have with us.</p>\n<p>\n<b>\n<i>Future Amendments to this Agreement to Arbitrate</i>\n</b>\n</p>\n<p>Notwithstanding any provision in the user agreement to the contrary, you and we agree that if we make any amendment to this Agreement to Arbitrate (other than an amendment to any notice address or website link provided herein) in the future, that amendment shall not apply to any claim that was filed in a legal proceeding against PayPal prior to the effective date of the amendment.\nThe amendment shall apply to all other disputes or claims governed by this Agreement to Arbitrate that have arisen or may arise between you and PayPal.\nWe will notify you of amendments to this Agreement to Arbitrate by posting the amended terms on www.paypal.com at least 30 days before the effective date of the amendments and by providing notice through email.\nIf you do not agree to these amended terms, you may close your PayPal account within the 30-day period and you will not be bound by the amended terms.</p> Intellectual Property

(commonly grandchildren) and claims there is an emergency requiring you to send money.</li>\n<li>Lottery or Prize: a scammer informs you that you\u2019ve won a lottery or prize and must send money in

tools and services that are designed to help you make financial progress.\nBefore you get started, we\u2019d like to tell you more about what we do with information we collect about you.</p>\n<p>When you use, access or interact with our Services (which we define for you in Section 1 of our Terms of Service,&nbsp;accessible here), you are agreeing to our Terms of Service and consenting to how we collect, share and otherwise use information about you as described in this Privacy Policy.\nSince we do collect information about you, you should also know we\u2019re committed to securing our systems and the protection of your data.\nYou can find more details on our&nbsp;Security Practices&nbsp;here.</p>\n<p>In other words, as legalese-y as they are, please read these documents carefully.</p>\nWhat This Policy Covers\n<p>This Privacy Policy covers how Credit Karma, Inc.\nand its affiliated companies (collectively, \u201cCredit Karma,\u201d \u201cwe,\u201d \u201cus\u201d or \u201cour\u201d) collect, use, and share information in connection with your access and use of our Services.\nIt does not cover the privacy practices of third parties that we do not own or control.</p>\n<p>That said, you should know that we may provide third party content or links to third-party web sites or applications, or include features that allow you to connect your Credit Karma account with your accounts with third parties, such as financial institutions or social media platforms like Facebook.\nWhen you leave our Services or interact with a third-party feature, you should also read the applicable third party\u2019s privacy policies and terms of service to make sure you understand how they might collect and share information about you (everybody is different).</p>\nWhat Information We Collect\n<p>To put it simply, there are three main ways we collect information about you: when you give it to us, with automatic technologies and when we ask others for it.\nAllow us to explain.</p>\nInformation You Provide to Us\n<p>You may provide information to us in various ways, such as through forms, features or other means offered through our Services.\nA couple of examples include information you provide to us when registering as a member, and feedback forms where you send us comments, questions, or other feedback.\nThe types of information you provide us fits into two general categories:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>Personal Information</strong>: This is information that identifies you personally, such as your full name, street address, email address, Social Security number or phone number.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Non-Personal Information</strong>: This is information about you or your household that doesn\u2019t identify you personally, like your gender, income or what types of financial products you\u2019re interested in.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>When we combine information that isn\u2019t Personal Information (like Non-Personal Information or Usage Information, which we explain below) with Personal Information, we treat it like Personal Information for as long as it is combined.</p>\nInformation We Automatically Collect\n<p>In addition to information you provide to us, we automatically collect certain information about how you access and interact with our Services (\u201cUsage Information\u201d).\nThis Usage Information is a key part of how we improve your Credit Karma experience and provide you with more personalized insights and recommendations.\nWe and our partners may use various technologies to collect and store Usage Information in connection with our Services.\nThese may include things like cookies, browser web storage (e.g., HTML5), web beacons and similar technologies.\nThere are three types of Usage Information we may collect:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>Device Information</strong>.\nThis is information about how you access our Services, such as the operating system, hardware model, application or browser type and version, and unique identifiers associated with your device.\nWe may also integrate with built-in device features (e.g., when you turn on fingerprint access for your Credit Karma account).</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Log Information</strong>.\nThere are certain pieces of information we automatically collect in system logs or similar files about how you interact with our Services, such as which features you visit or click on.\nThis Log Information may also include things like your IP address, browser or device configuration, date and time of access and cookie information.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Location Information</strong>.\nWe may use certain information like your IP address or other Device Information or Log Information to estimate your location (e.g., your city or state).\nWe may also request to use location-enabled services on your device (which typically provide GPS or Wi-Fi access point details) to enhance our Services.\nWe will only use these location-enabled services on your device with your consent, though.</li>\n</ul>\nInformation Third Parties Provide About You\n<p>Many of our features rely on information about you that we collect from third parties, such as the free credit reports and credit scores we request on your behalf from TransUnion and Equifax.\nWe may also work with different third party partners to supplement the Usage Information and other information we collect directly from you.\nFor example, our partners may provide us with information such as employment or income data, vehicle or driver information, or information about special offers available based on your credit profile so that we can give you more personalized recommendations.\nWe might also collect information from other users like you through things like a member referral program.</p>\nHow We Use the Information We Collect\n<p>We use the information we collect from you and third parties to operate our Services, communicate with you, conduct research and development to improve or enhance our Services and our users\u2019 experience, and promote our Services.\nThese are a few examples:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>To create your account and provide the Services to you</strong>.\nWe use the information we collect to create and secure your account, create and maintain your Member Profile, and to provide the Services to you.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>To provide features to you, such as your free credit reports and scores</strong>.\nWe use the information we collect to provide you with free credit reports and scores from our credit bureau partners.\nCredit Karma offers much more than free credit reports and scores though.\nthe information we collect also goes into developing and bringing you various other features like free credit monitoring, ID monitoring, tracking your spending, and personalized offer recommendations.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>To improve our recommendations and insights</strong>.\nThe information we collect also helps us tailor our content and improve the way we match you to recommended offers or insights.\nWe\u2019re constantly working on ways to better identify and present the information that\u2019s most relevant to you.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>To communicate with you</strong>.\nWe use information we collect to provide you with member support or to send you things like service-related announcements, credit or ID monitoring alerts, recommendations, offers from our partners and other updates or promotions.\nMost of the time we\u2019ll communicate with you by email, but we may also send you push notifications, browser notifications, or even snail mail.\nFor information on how to adjust your communications preferences, check out the \u201cCommunications Preferences\u201d section of this policy, below.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>To conduct research and to improve and promote our services</strong>.\nWe use the information we collect to conduct research and to improve or enhance and promote our Services.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>For legal reasons</strong>.\nWe reserve the right to access, use, preserve, transfer or disclose, at any time without notice to you, any information (including Personal Information) as reasonably necessary to:\n<ul>\n<li>Comply with any applicable law, regulation, subpoena or legal process, or respond to any governmental requests and cooperate with law enforcement, if we believe such action is required or permitted by law;</li>\n<li>Enforce our&nbsp;Terms of Service, including investigating any potential violations;</li>\n<li>Protect the safety, integrity, rights or security of our members, our Services or equipment, or any third party.\nor</li>\n<li>Detect, prevent or otherwise address fraud, security or technical issues related to our Services or our partners.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\nWhen We Share the Information We Collect\n<p>First, we want to be clear about how we do not share information about you (what we call the \u201cNo-Nos\u201d):</p>\n<ul>\n<li>We do&nbsp;<em>not</em>&nbsp;share your credit reports or scores with unaffiliated third parties (except agents acting on our behalf.\nwe explain that below).</li>\n<li>We do&nbsp;<em>not</em>&nbsp;sell your Personal Information to or share your Personal Information with unaffiliated third parties for their own advertising or marketing purposes.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Now that we\u2019ve covered the No-Nos, let us explain how we could share with third parties.\nWe may share information about you, including Personal Information, with third parties in a variety of ways, such as:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>Agents acting on our behalf</strong>.\nWe may share information about you with service providers or agents in order to have them perform on our behalf any of the activities we are permitted to conduct under this Privacy Policy and our Terms of Service.\nThis includes things like designing or operating features, helping us research and test feature improvements, identifying offers or personalized recommendations, performing analytics and marketing our Services.\nThese third parties are acting on our behalf so while they may have access to your information, including things like your credit reports and scores, they\u2019re required to follow our instructions and meet the standards explained in our Privacy Policy when handling information about you that we provide them.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>When we collaborate with third parties to provide and improve our Services</strong>.\nWe may sometimes share information about you with third parties we collaborate with in connection with providing or improving our Services.\nThis can occur, for example, when we\u2019re providing an integrated or co-branded feature with a partner (e.g., our Credit Score Simulator) or doing a joint research project with another organization to help improve our Services.\nWe may also share information like the feedback you submit to us if it relates to both our Services and a partner\u2019s products.\nWhen we share information with third-party collaborators, our collaborators are obligated to follow the No-Nos above, but may also use the information in connection with their own activities to the extent allowed under their own privacy practices (e.g., respond to your feedback, conduct additional research, or improve a feature of theirs).</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Our partners when you ask for their services</strong>.\nWe may also give you opportunities to interact with third party partners through our Services, such as when we provide you with the opportunity to review and send your personal information to a partner in order to pre-populate your application on the partner\u2019s site or we send you to the partner\u2019s site for you to provide the information directly to them.\nIn some cases, if you click through to go to a partner\u2019s site, you will automatically be sending your personal information to that partner.\nWhen this happens, you will still have to submit your application on the partner\u2019s site.\nRemember that any information you provide to the partner, whether through us or on your own, will be subject to their privacy practices and terms and conditions.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>When you publicly post the information</strong>.\nAs part of our Services, we may provide opportunities for you to publicly post reviews, questions, comments, suggestions or other content, which may include Personal Information and portions of your Member Profile designated as public profile information, like your name or user name.\nAnything you share in a public forum is, obviously, public, so think carefully about what you decide to share.\nYou should also read our&nbsp;Community Rules&nbsp;for more information on what is appropriate to post.\nIf you would like us to remove Personal Information included in Community Content, contact us&nbsp;here.\nIn some cases, we may not be able to remove your Personal Information, but we will try to respond to let you know why.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>As Part of a Corporate Change</strong>.\nWe may disclose and transfer information about you to a third party as part of, or in preparation for, a change of control, restructuring, corporate change, or sale or transfer of assets.\nIf such a business transfer results in a material change in the treatment of your Personal Information, you will be notified by e-mail (using the primary email address on your account) or by a prominent notice on our site.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>For Legal Reasons</strong>.\nWe reserve the right to transfer or disclose information about you to third parties for certain legal purposes.\n(You can read more about these in the \u201cHow We Use the Information We Collect\u201d section above.)</li>\n<li>\n<strong>With Your Consent</strong>.\nThere may also be other limited contexts in which we share specific types of personal information with your express consent.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>We may also share with third parties de-identified or aggregated data we collect, such as de-identified or aggregated credit reports or scores, de-identified demographic information, or information about the computer or device from which you access the Service.\nWe share such information for a variety of purposes, including to analyze Service usage, develop shared services, and improve our own products and features.</p>\nHow to Access, Update or Deactivate Your Account\nAccessing and Updating Your Account Information\n<p>You are responsible for maintaining the accuracy of the information you provide to us, such as your Member Profile information.\nYou can access and make changes to certain Personal Information by logging in to your account through our website and updating your \u201cPersonal Information\u201d page.</p>\nCommunications Preferences\n<p>You can manage your communications preferences by visiting&nbsp;your account profile.\nFor example, you can choose which types of monitoring alerts you want to receive.\nWe\u2019ll also include \u201cunsubscribe\u201d instructions in marketing emails.\nYou may also have the ability to adjust app- or browser-specific communications settings (e.g., for things like push or browser notifications) within the settings screen of your mobile app or browser.\nTechnology moves fast, so the types of communications and communication preference options might change from time to time.</p>\nCanceling Your Membership and Deactivating Your Account\n<p>We hope this never happens, but if you decide you no longer want to use our Services, you can cancel and deactivate your account on our&nbsp;help page.</p>\n<p>One more thing to note: Due to our recordkeeping and information retention requirements, we do not delete information about you upon deactivation.\nWe will, however, disable your account and stop sending you further communications.\nFurthermore, except to the extent necessary for legal or regulatory recordkeeping purposes, we anonymize the data in your Member Profile two years after you deactivate your account.\nIt may take a little more time for our automated backup systems to fully process the anonymized account, though.</p>\nOur Interest-Based Advertisement Practices\nAdvertising Service Providers\n<p>Some of our third-party service providers or partners are advertising networks, marketing partners, publishers and other entities who perform analytics and advertise our products and services on websites not affiliated with us (\u201cAdvertising Service Providers\u201d).\nIn connection with these advertising services, we or our Advertising Service Providers, like Google Analytics (more on this below) may use cookies, web beacons, and similar technologies to collect behavioral information about how you use our site or other websites in order to perform tracking and marketing analytics or serve advertisements that are more likely to be of interest to you (\u201cInterest-Based Advertisements\u201d).\nOur Advertising Service Providers may permit you to opt out of all or some Interest-Based Advertisements on designated websites.\nFor example, many of our Advertising Service Providers participate in the&nbsp;Network Advertising Initiative&nbsp;opt-out program or the&nbsp;Digital Advertising Alliance opt-out program.</p>\nDisclosure Regarding Google Analytics Advertising Features\n<p>In addition to services from other Advertising Service Providers, we use the following Google Analytics Advertising Features as part of our marketing analytics and advertising: Remarketing with Google Analytics, Google Display Network Impression Reporting, DoubleClick Platform integrations and Google Analytics Demographics and Interest Reporting.\nWe may also use other services provided by Google Analytics from time to time.\nAt present, Google provides users an opportunity to opt-out of the Google Analytics Features through Google\u2019s Ads Settings and their&nbsp;web browser opt-out plugin.\nHowever, we do not control these opt outs, which may be updated or removed by Google in accordance with its own policies.\nFor additional information on opting out of interest-based ads by Google, you can visit Google\u2019s Opt out page&nbsp;here.</p>\nDo Not Track Signals\n<p>At this time, we do not respond to automated signals regarding tracking mechanisms, including \u201cdo not track\u201d instructions from your browser.\nPlease note that blocking cookies may affect your browsing experience on many sites and may limit your ability to use certain features of our Services, including many of the personalized features we provide for our members.</p>\nOur Security Practices and Social Security Protection Policy Statement\n<p>Credit Karma maintains physical, electronic, administrative and procedural safeguards intended to protect the confidentiality of Personal Information that we collect about you, including Social Security numbers.\nWe limit access to Social Security numbers to help protect against their loss or misuse and we do not disclose Social Security numbers to third parties except with your consent, or where such disclosure is required or permitted by law.\nRead more about&nbsp;our Security Practices.</p>\n<p>If you have any questions about security on our Services, you can contact us&nbsp;here.</p>\nChanges to Our Privacy Policy\n<p>We reserve the right to change this Privacy Policy at any time without notice to you.\nIf there are any material changes in the way we treat your credit report information or Personal Information, Credit Karma will send a notice to the primary email address on your account or place a prominent notice on our platform before the change goes into effect.\nCredit Karma will also promptly make an updated Privacy Policy publicly available on our platform.\nChanges will be effective as soon as the revised Privacy Policy is posted unless otherwise stated.</p>\nWant More Information?\n<p>Thanks for taking the time to read through all this.\nIf you have questions regarding this policy or privacy practices at Credit Karma, you can contact our legal department&nbsp;here&nbsp;or write to us at: Credit Karma, Inc.\nAttention: Legal Department, P.O.\nBox 520, San Francisco, CA 94104-0520.</p>\n<p>Looking for our previous version?

here.\nThat\u2019s because there are hundreds of scoring models out there, and they all weigh things a little differently.\nMost scores are generally based on similar credit factors though, so tracking one or two should still give you a good overview of your credit health.</p>\n3.4 Not a Legal or Professional Advisor\n<p>Credit Karma is not a credit repair organization, credit counselor, or

you will cooperate fully in the defense of any such claims.</p>\nSummary\n<p>If someone sues us because of something you did, you\u2019re responsible for it, so read the above carefully.</p>\n10.\nDispute Resolution and Arbitration\nSummary\n<p>A third party arbitrator will help us resolve any disputes we might have.\nThis means that any dispute will be resolved outside of class-action litigation.\nHopefully, disputes will never be an issue, but you should read this section carefully for details on how it works.</p>\n10.1 Generally\n<p>In the interest of resolving disputes between you and Credit Karma in the most expedient and cost-effective manner, you and Credit Karma agree that any and all disputes arising in connection with the Agreement will be resolved by binding arbitration.\nYou and us further agree that the Federal Arbitration Act (\u201cFAA\u201d) governs the interpretation and enforcement of this arbitration provision.\nthe arbitrator shall apply California law to all other matters.\nArbitration is less formal than a lawsuit in court.\nArbitration uses a neutral arbitrator instead of a judge or jury, may allow for more limited discovery than in court, and can be subject to very limited review by courts.\nArbitrators can award the same damages and relief that a court can award.\n&nbsp;All issues are for the arbitrator to decide, including all claims arising out of or relating to any aspect of the Agreement, whether based in contract, tort, statute, fraud, misrepresentation, or any other legal theory, and regardless of whether a claim arises during or after the termination of the Agreement.\nThe arbitrator also has exclusive authority to resolve any dispute relating to the interpretation, applicability, or enforceability of this binding arbitration agreement.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>YOU UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT BY ENTERING INTO THE AGREEMENT AND AGREEING TO ARBITRATION, YOU AND CREDIT KARMA ARE EACH WAIVING THE RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY OR TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION.\nYOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE EXPRESSLY AND KNOWINGLY WAIVED THESE RIGHTS.</strong>\n</p>\n10.2 Exceptions\n<p>Despite the provisions of Section 10.1, you and us both agree that nothing in the Agreement will be deemed to waive, preclude or otherwise limit the right of either of us to: (a) bring an individual action in small claims court within its jurisdictional limits under Consumer Arbitration Rule 9(b), even after filing an arbitration.\n(b) file a complaint with the applicable federal, state, or local agency if that action is available.\n(c) seek injunctive relief in a court of law in aid of a pending arbitration.\nor (d) to file a suit in a court of law solely for injunctive relief to stop unauthorized use or abuse of our Services or address an intellectual property infringement claim.</p>\n10.3 Arbitrator\n<p>Any arbitration between you and Credit Karma will be conducted under the Consumer Arbitration Rules (\u201c<strong>AAA Rules</strong>\u201c) of the American Arbitration Association (\u201c<strong>AAA</strong>\u201c), as modified by the Agreement, and will be administered by the AAA.\nThe AAA Rules and filing forms are available online at www.adr.org, by calling the AAA at 1-800-778-7879, or by contacting Credit Karma here.</p>\n10.4 Notice and Process\n<p>A party who intends to seek arbitration must first send a written notice of the dispute to the other by certified mail (\u201c<strong>Notice</strong>\u201c).\nCredit Karma\u2019s address for Notice is: Credit Karma, LLC, P.O.\nBox 30963, Oakland, CA 94604, Attention: Legal Department.\nThe Notice must: (a) describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute.\nand (b) set forth the specific relief sought (\u201c<strong>Demand</strong>\u201c).\nYou and Credit Karma agree to use good faith efforts to resolve the claim directly, but if you and Credit Karma do not reach an agreement to do so within 30 days after the Notice is received, you or we may commence an arbitration proceeding.\nDuring the arbitration, the amount of any settlement offer made by you or Credit Karma must not be disclosed to the arbitrator until after the arbitrator makes a final decision and award, if any.\nThe arbitration proceedings, including any exchanged materials, shall be confidential and you and Credit Karma agree to use reasonable efforts to streamline the proceedings, including discovery, consistent with the objectives of efficient dispute resolution.</p>\n10.5 Fees\n<p>If you commence arbitration in accordance with the Agreement, Credit Karma will reimburse you for your payment of the filing fee, unless your claim is for more than $10,000, in which case the payment of any fees will be decided by the AAA Rules.\nAny arbitration hearing will take place at a location to be agreed upon in San Francisco, California, but if the claim is for $10,000 or less, or as otherwise required, you may choose whether the arbitration will be conducted: (a) solely on the basis of documents submitted to the arbitrator.\n(b) through a non-appearance based telephone hearing.\nor (c) by an in-person hearing as established by the AAA Rules in the county (or parish) of your registered account address.\nAll issues are for the arbitrator to decide, including issues relating to the scope and enforceability of this arbitration provision.&nbsp.\nIf the arbitrator finds that either the substance of the claim or the relief sought in the Demand is frivolous or brought for an improper purpose (as measured by the standards set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)), then the payment of all fees will be governed by the AAA Rules.\nIn that case, you agree to reimburse Credit Karma for all monies previously disbursed by it that are otherwise your obligation to pay under the AAA Rules.\nLikewise, Credit Karma will not seek its attorneys\u2019 fees or costs in arbitration unless the arbitrator determines your claims or defenses are frivolous.\nRegardless of the manner in which the arbitration is conducted, the arbitrator must issue a reasoned written decision sufficient to explain the

not to do so, in many cases we will not be able to provide you with our products or services or respond to any queries you may have.</p>\n<p>Here are some examples of the types of personal information Apple may collect and how we may use it:</p>\nWhat personal information we collect\n<ul>\n<li>When you create an Apple ID, apply for commercial credit, purchase a product, download a software update,

social media.</li>\n<li>When you share your content with family and friends using Apple products, send gift certificates and products, or invite others to participate in Apple services or forums, Apple may collect the information you provide about those people such as name, mailing address, email address, and phone number.\nApple will use such information to fulfill your requests, provide the relevant product or service, or for anti-fraud purposes.</li>\n<li>In certain jurisdictions, we may ask for a government issued ID in limited circumstances including when setting up a wireless account and activating your device, for the purpose of extending commercial credit, managing reservations, or as required by law.</li>\n</ul>\nHow we use your personal&nbsp;information\n<p>We may process your personal information: for the purposes described in this Privacy Policy, with your consent, for compliance with a legal obligation to which Apple is subject, for the performance of a contract to which you are party, in order to protect your vital interests, or when we have assessed it is necessary for the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by Apple or a third party to whom it may be necessary to disclose information.\nIf you have questions about this legal basis you can contact the Data Protection Officer.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The personal information we collect allows us to keep you posted on Apple\u2019s latest product announcements, software updates, and upcoming events.\nIf you don\u2019t want to be on our mailing list, you can opt-out anytime by updating your preferences.</li>\n<li>We also use personal information to help us create, develop, operate, deliver, and improve our products, services, content and advertising, and for loss prevention and anti-fraud purposes.\nWe may also use your personal information for account and network security purposes, including in order to protect our services for the benefit of all our users, and pre-screening or scanning uploaded content for potentially illegal content, including child sexual exploitation material.\nWhere we use your information for anti-fraud purposes it arises from the conduct of an online transaction with us.\nWe limit our uses of data for anti-fraud purposes to those which are strictly necessary and within our assessed legitimate interests to protect our customers and our services.\nFor certain online transactions we may also validate the information provided by you with publicly accessible sources.</li>\n<li>We may use your personal information, including date of birth, to verify identity, assist with identification of users, and to determine appropriate services.\nFor example, we may use date of birth to determine the age of Apple ID account holders.</li>\n<li>From time to time, we may use your personal information to send important notices, such as communications about purchases and changes to our terms, conditions, and policies.\nBecause this information is important to your interaction with Apple, you may not opt out of receiving these communications.</li>\n<li>We may also use personal information for internal purposes such as auditing, data analysis, and research to improve Apple\u2019s products, services, and customer communications.</li>\n<li>If you enter into a sweepstake, contest, or similar promotion we may use the information you provide to administer those programs.</li>\n<li>If you apply for a position at Apple or we receive your information in connection with a potential role at Apple, we may use your information to evaluate your candidacy and to contact you.\nIf you are a candidate, you will receive more information about how Apple handles candidate personal information at the time of application.</li>\n</ul>\nSource of your personal information where they are not collected from you\n<p>We may have received your personal information from other persons if that person has shared their content with you using Apple products, sent gift certificates and products, or invited you to participate in Apple services or forums.\nWe may also validate the information provided by you when creating an Apple ID with a third party for security and fraud prevention purposes.</p>\n<p>If you are a potential candidate for employment with Apple, we may have received your personal information from third parties such as recruiters or external websites.\nWe will use the personal information we receive to contact you about a potential opportunity or in evaluating your candidacy.\nIf you did not provide us your personal information directly, we will inform you of the source when we first contact you regarding your candidacy.\nFor research and development purposes, we may use datasets such as those that contain images, voices or other data that could be associated with an identifiable person.\nWhen acquiring such datasets, we do so in accordance with applicable law in the jurisdiction in which the dataset is hosted.\nWhen using such datasets for research and development, we do not attempt to re-identify individuals who may appear therein.</p>\nCollection and Use of Non-Personal Information\n<p>We also collect data in a form that does not, on its own, permit direct association with any specific individual.\nWe may collect, use, transfer, and disclose non-personal information for any purpose.\nThe following are some examples of non-personal information that we collect and how we may use it:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>We may collect information such as occupation, language, zip code, area code, unique device identifier, referrer URL, location, and the time zone where an Apple product is used so that we can better understand customer behavior and improve our products, services, and advertising.</li>\n<li>We may collect information regarding customer activities on our website, iCloud services, our iTunes Store, App Store, Mac App Store, App Store for Apple TV and iBooks Stores and from our other products and services.\nThis information is aggregated and used to help us provide more useful information to our customers and to understand which parts of our website, products, and services are of most interest.\nAggregated data is considered non\u2011personal information for the purposes of this Privacy Policy.</li>\n<li>We may collect and store details of how you use our services, including search queries.\nThis information may be used to improve the relevancy of results provided by our services.\nExcept in limited instances to ensure quality of our services over the Internet, such information will not be associated with your IP address.</li>\n<li>With your explicit consent, we may collect data about how you use your device and applications in order to help app developers improve their apps.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If we do combine non-personal information with personal information the combined information will be treated as personal information for as long as it remains combined.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\nCookies and Other Technologies\n<p>Apple\u2019s websites, online services, interactive applications, email messages, and advertisements may use \"cookies\" and other technologies such as pixel tags and web beacons.\nThese technologies help us better understand user behavior, tell us which parts of our websites people have visited, and facilitate and measure the effectiveness of advertisements and web searches.\nWe treat information collected by cookies and other technologies as non\u2011personal information.\nHowever, to the extent that Internet Protocol (IP) addresses or similar identifiers are considered personal information by local law, we also treat these identifiers as personal information.\nSimilarly, to the extent that non-personal information is combined with personal information, we treat the combined information as personal information for the purposes of this Privacy Policy.</p>\n<p>Ads that are delivered by Apple\u2019s advertising platform may appear in Apple News and in the App Store.\nIf you do not wish to receive ads targeted to your interests from Apple's advertising platform, you can choose to enable Limit Ad Tracking, which will opt your Apple ID out of receiving such ads regardless of what device you are using.\nIf you enable Limit Ad Tracking on your mobile device, third-party apps cannot use the Advertising Identifier, a non-personal device identifier, to serve you targeted ads.\nYou may still see ads in the App Store or News based on context like your search query or the channel you are reading.\nIn third-party apps, you may see ads based on other information.</p>\n<p>Apple also uses cookies and other technologies to remember personal information when you use our website, online services, and applications.\nOur goal in these cases is to make your experience with Apple more convenient and personal.\nFor example, knowing your first name lets us welcome you the next time you visit the Apple Online Store.\nKnowing your country and language \u2212 and if you are an educator, your school \u2212 helps us provide a customized and more useful shopping experience.\nKnowing someone using your computer or device has shopped for a certain product or used a particular service helps us make our advertising and email communications more relevant to your interests.\nAnd knowing your contact information, hardware identifiers, and information about your computer or device helps us personalize your operating system, set up your iCloud service, and provide you with better customer service.</p>\n<p>If you want to disable cookies and you\u2019re using the Safari web browser, go to Safari preferences and then to the privacy pane to manage your preferences.\nOn your Apple mobile device, go to Settings, then Safari, scroll down to the Privacy &amp.\nSecurity section, and tap on \u201cBlock Cookies\u201d to manage your preferences.\nFor other browsers, check with your provider to find out how to disable cookies.\nPlease note that certain features of the Apple website will not be available once cookies are disabled.</p>\n<p>As is true of most internet services, we gather some information automatically and store it in log files.\nThis information includes Internet Protocol (IP) addresses, browser type and language, Internet service provider (ISP), referring and exit websites and applications, operating system, date/time stamp, and clickstream data.\nWe use this information to understand and analyze trends, to administer the site, to learn about user behavior on the site, to improve our product and services, and to gather demographic information about our user base as a whole.\nApple may use this information in our marketing and advertising services.</p>\n<p>In some of our email messages, we use a \u201cclick-through URL\u201d linked to content on the Apple website.\nWhen customers click one of these URLs, they pass through a separate web server before arriving at the destination page on our website.\nWe track this click-through data to help us determine interest in particular topics and measure the effectiveness of our customer communications.\nIf you prefer not to be tracked in this way, you should not click text or graphic links in the email messages.\nPixel tags enable us to send email messages in a format customers can read, and they tell us whether mail has been opened.\nWe may use this information to reduce or eliminate messages sent to customers.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\nDisclosure to Third Parties\n<p>At times Apple may provide third parties with certain personal information to provide or improve our products and services, including to deliver products at your request, or to help Apple market to consumers.\nWhen we do, we require those third parties to handle it in accordance with relevant laws.\nApple does not sell personal information, and personal information will never be shared with third parties for their marketing purposes.\nFor example, when you purchase and activate your iPhone, you authorize Apple and your carrier to exchange the information you provide during the activation process to carry out service, including information about your device.\nIf you are approved for service, your account will be governed by Apple and your carrier\u2019s respective privacy policies.</p>\nService Providers\n<p>Apple shares personal information with companies who provide services such as information processing, extending credit, fulfilling customer orders, delivering products to you, managing and enhancing customer data, providing customer service, assessing your interest in our products and services, and conducting customer research or satisfaction surveys.\nThese companies are obligated to protect your information and may be located wherever Apple operates.</p>\nOthers\n<p>It may be necessary \u2212 by law, legal process, litigation, and/or requests from public and governmental authorities within or outside your country of residence \u2212 for Apple to disclose your personal information.\nWe may also disclose information about you if we determine that for purposes of national security, law enforcement, or other issues of public importance, disclosure is necessary or appropriate.\nWe may also disclose information about you, but only where there is a lawful basis for doing so, if we determine that disclosure is reasonably necessary to enforce our terms and conditions or protect our operations or users.&nbsp.\nThis could include providing information to public or governmental authorities.\nAdditionally, in the event of a reorganization, merger, or sale we may transfer any and all personal information we collect to the relevant third party.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\nProtection of Personal&nbsp;Information\n<p>Apple takes the security of your personal information very seriously.\nApple online services such as the Apple Online Store and iTunes Store protect your personal information during transit using encryption such as Transport Layer Security (TLS).\nWhen your personal data is stored by Apple, we use computer systems with limited access housed in facilities using physical security measures.\nWith the exception of iCloud Mail, iCloud data is stored in encrypted form including when we utilize third-party storage.</p>\n<p>When you use some Apple products, services, or applications or post on an Apple forum, chat room, or social networking service, the personal information and content you share is visible to other users and can be read, collected, or used by them.\nYou are responsible for the personal information you choose to share or submit in these instances.\nFor example, if you list your name and email address in a forum posting, that information is public.\nPlease take care when using these features.</p>\n<p>If you or anyone else using Family Sharing logs on to a device that is owned by a third party, any information shared within your Family\u2014including calendar, location, photos, and iTunes purchases\u2014may be downloaded on to that third-party device thereby disclosing any such shared information.\nVisit Family Sharing for more information.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\nThe Existence of Automated Decision-Making, Including Profiling\n<p>Apple does not take any decisions involving the use of algorithms or profiling that significantly affect you.</p>\nIntegrity and Retention of Personal Information\n<p>Apple makes it easy for you to keep your personal information accurate, complete, and up to date.\nWe will retain your personal information for the period necessary to fulfill the purposes outlined in this Privacy Policy and our service specific privacy summaries.\nWhen assessing these periods we carefully examine our need to collect personal information at all and if we establish a relevant need we only retain it for the shortest possible period to realize the purpose of collection unless a longer retention period is required by law.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\nYour Privacy Rights\n<p>You can help ensure that your contact information and preferences are accurate, complete, and up to date by signing in to your Apple ID account page.\nFor other personal information we hold, we will provide you with access (including a copy) for any purpose including to request that we correct the data if it is inaccurate or delete the data if Apple is not required to retain it by law or for legitimate business purposes.</p>\n<p>We may decline to process requests that are frivolous/vexatious, jeopardize the privacy of others, are extremely impractical, or for which access is not otherwise required by local law.\nWe may also decline aspects of deletion or access requests if we believe doing so would undermine our legitimate use of data for anti-fraud and security purposes as described earlier.\nOnline tools for the exercise of access, deactivation/restriction, correction, or deletion requests are available on a regional basis by signing in to privacy.apple.com.\nFor users with Shazam accounts sign in to www.shazam.com/privacy.\nWhen you make a request using these online tools, we will verify your identity and the legitimacy of your request.</p>\nCalifornia\n<p>The California Consumer Privacy Act provides California consumers with the right to obtain from Apple information about the personal information about you that we collect, use, and disclose.\nYou can exercise your rights through an authorized agent by providing relevant details to allow sign in to privacy.apple.com.\nIf you cannot access Apple\u2019s online tools, you or your agent can make a request to apple.com/legal/privacy/contact or by calling 1-800-275-2273.</p>\n<p>If you choose to

understand the importance of taking extra precautions to protect the privacy and safety of children using Apple products and services.\nChildren under the age of 13, or equivalent minimum age in the relevant jurisdiction, are not permitted to create their own Apple IDs, unless their parent provided verifiable consent or as part of the child account creation process in Family Sharing or they have obtained a Managed Apple ID account (where available) through their school.\nFor example, a parent must review the Apple ID and Family Sharing Disclosure and agree to the Consent to Apple\u2019s Collection, Use and Disclosure of Your Child\u2019s Information.\nand the iTunes Store Terms and Conditions, before they can begin the Apple ID account creation process for their child.\nIn addition,

children\u2019s accounts.\nIf we learn that we have collected the personal information of a child under 13, or equivalent minimum age depending on jurisdiction, outside the above circumstances we will take steps to delete the information as soon as possible.\nIf at any time a parent needs to access, correct, or delete data associated with their Family Sharing account or child\u2019s Apple ID, they may contact us through one of the options provided at the bottom of this page.</p>\nLocation-Based Services\n<p>To provide location-based services on Apple products, Apple and our partners and licensees, such as maps data providers, may collect, use, and share precise location data, including the real-time geographic location of your Apple computer or device.\nWhere available, location-based services may use GPS, Bluetooth, and your IP Address, along with crowd-sourced Wi-Fi hotspot and cell tower locations, and other technologies to determine your devices\u2019 approximate location.\nUnless you provide consent, this location data is collected anonymously in a form that does not personally identify you and is used by Apple and our partners and licensees to provide and improve location-based products and services.\nFor example, your device may share its geographic location with application providers when you opt in to their location services.</p>\n<p>Some location-based services offered by Apple, such as the \u201cFind My\u201d feature, require your personal information for the feature to work.</p>\nThird\u2011Party Sites and Services\n<p>Apple websites, products, applications, and services may contain links to third-party websites, products, and services.\nOur products and services may also use or offer products or services from third parties \u2212 for example, a third\u2011party iPhone app.</p>\n<p>Information collected by third parties, which may include such things as location data or contact details, is governed by their privacy practices.\nWe encourage you to learn about the privacy practices of those third parties.</p>\n<p>If you purchase a subscription in a third party app or within News, we create a Subscriber ID that is unique to you and the developer or publisher which we use to provide reports to the developer or publisher that include information about the subscription you purchased, and your country of residence.\nIf you cancel all of your subscriptions with a particular developer or publisher, the Subscriber ID will reset after 180 days if you do not resubscribe.\nThis information is provided to

transfer of personal information collected in the European Economic Area and Switzerland.\nApple, as a global company, has a number of legal entities in different jurisdictions which are responsible for the personal information which they collect and which is processed on their behalf by Apple Inc.\nFor example, point of sale information in our Retail entities outside the U.S.\nis controlled by our individual Retail entities in each country.\nApple, Online Store and iTunes related personal information may also be controlled by legal entities outside the U.S.\nas reflected in the terms of

contacts page for details of who to contact.\n</p>\n<p> 2 <b>Important:</b> We store all data on servers in New Zealand, Canada and Europe.\nIf you access your data or give someone else access to your data using our services and you or they are not in New Zealand, Canada or Europe, you or they may be accessing that data from a country that does not give adequate protection to personal information when compared to that given under, the New Zealand Privacy Act 2020, the Canadian Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act 2000 or the General Data Protection Regulation (\u201c<b>GDPR</b>\u201d).\nBy agreeing to these terms, you authorise us to grant that access.\n</p>\n<p> 3 These terms are binding and apply to any use of the services by you and anyone who you allow to access your data or our services.\nBy using our services, you and they irrevocably agree to these terms.\nIf you do not like these terms or don't want to be bound by them, you can't use our services.\nIn particular, OUR SERVICES ARE PROVIDED SUBJECT TO CERTAIN DISCLAIMERS BY US AND UNDERTAKINGS BY YOU, INCLUDING AN INDEMNITY FROM YOU IF YOU BREACH THESE TERMS - see clauses 40-51.\nNEW ZEALAND LAW AND ARBITRATION OF ANY DISPUTES APPLIES EXCLUSIVELY - see clauses 52 and 53.\n</p>\n<p> 4 We can change these terms at any time by providing you at least 30 days' prior notice of the change, whether via email or via a message in any service we provide.\nYour continued use after that notice means that you agree to the changed terms.\nIf you have paid for a subscription that is due to expire after that 30 day notice period and you do not wish to continue to use our services under the new terms, you may terminate your subscription before the new terms come into force.\nWe will then (but not otherwise) refund the unexpired portion of your subscription payment within 30 days and close your account.\nFor more information about refunds, recurring paid subscriptions and their termination, see clauses 58-60.\n</p>\n<p> 5 If you comply with these terms, then we grant you a non-exclusive, non-transferable, worldwide licence to access and use our services, in accordance with these terms and any plan you have subscribed for.\n</p> Your data <p> 6 If you allow others to access your data (e.g.\nby giving them a link to, and a key to decrypt, that data), in addition to them accepting these terms, you are responsible for their actions and omissions while they are using our services and you agree to fully indemnify us for any claim, loss, damage, fine, costs (including our legal fees) and other liability if they breach any of these terms.\nThis is particularly the case where you are the administrator of a business account (see clauses 33-35 and 54-57 below).\n</p>\n<p> 7 UCE is fundamental to our services.\nThis means that you, not us, have encrypted control of who has access to your data.\nYou should keep your password and Recovery Key safe and confidential.\nYou must not share your password with anyone else and should not release encryption keys to anyone else unless you wish them to have access to your data.\n<b>If you lose or misplace your password, you will lose access to your data</b>.\nEncryption won\u2019t help though if someone has full access to your system or device.\nWe strongly urge you to use best practices for ensuring the safety and security of your system and devices (e.g.\nvia unique passwords, security upgrades, firewall protection, anti-virus software, securing and encrypting your devices).\nMega will never send you emails asking for your password so do not be fooled by any such email since it will not be from us.\n</p>\n<p> 8 You must maintain copies of all data stored by you on our services.\nWe do not make any guarantees that there will be no loss of data or the services will be bug free.\nYou should download all data prior to termination of services.\n</p>\n<p> 9 Our service may automatically (without us viewing the file content) delete a file you upload, store, access or share where it determines that the file is an exact duplicate of a file already on our service (a process usually referred to as deduplication).\nIn that case, the original file will be accessed by you and any other user and that file will be retained as long as any user has a right to access it under these terms.\nAny right of deletion that you exercise will not apply to a deduplicated file that is associated with another user.\n</p>\n<p> 10 We will store your data subject to these terms and any plan you subscribe to.\nIf you choose to stop using our services, you must download your data first because after account closure we may, if we wish, delete all your data.\n<br>\n<br> If we suspend or terminate our services to you because you have breached these terms, or someone you have given access to has breached these terms, during the term of that suspension we may, if we wish, delete your data immediately or deny you access to your data but keep it for evidential purposes.\nSee also clauses 33-35 and 54-57 below which set out details of what happens to users within a business account when the business account is suspended or terminated.\n<br>\n<br> In circumstances where we cease providing our services for other reasons, we will, if we consider it appropriate, it is reasonably practicable and we are not prevented by law or likely to incur any liability in doing so, give you 30 days' notice to retrieve your data.\n</p> Your obligations <p> 11 Once you have subscribed to a plan for our services (with payment having been made via one of our websites, one of our mobile apps or one of our related or affiliated entities, payment processors and resellers), you need to continue to pay the fees (if any) for that plan (and any other taxes or duties).\nNo matter which reseller or related or affiliated entity of Mega you make payment to, your contract for services is with Mega Limited and is governed exclusively by these terms and our policies referenced in these terms.\n</p>\n<p> 12 We can at any time change the fees for our services (other than those you have already paid for) and/or the terms of any services we provide to you (including without limitation the terms of any \u2018achievements\u2019, \u2018referral\u2019 or similar programs we may offer), as long as we give you (subject at all times to clause 34), 30 days\u2019 notice of any such changes.\nWhere we change the fees for our services, in the absence of manifest error or other lawful error, you can't withhold payment or claim any set-off without getting our written agreement </p>\n<p> 13 If at any time you do not make a payment to us when you are supposed to (including on termination), we can (and this doesn't affect any other rights we may have against you): </p>\n<p> 13.1 suspend or terminate your use of the service and/or.\n</p>\n<p> 13.2 require you to pay, on demand, default interest on any amount you owe us at 10% per annum calculated on a daily basis, from the date when payment was due until the date when payment is actually made by you.\nYou will also need to pay all expenses and costs (including our full legal costs) in connection with us trying to recover any unpaid amount from you.\n</p>\n<p> 14 You must: </p>\n<p> 14.1 where you have subscribed for a service, always give us and keep up to date, your correct contact and any billing details and those of any users within a business account.\n</p>\n<p> 14.2 comply fully with any account verification protocols we require you to follow,

which you are administrator: </p>\n<p> 15.1 assign or transfer any rights you have under these terms to any other person (including by sharing your password with someone else) without our prior written consent.\n</p>\n<p> 15.2 do anything that would damage, disrupt or place an unreasonable burden on our service or anyone else's use of our service, including but not limited to denial of service attacks or similar.\n</p>\n<p> 15.3 infringe anyone else's intellectual property (including but not limited to copyright) or other rights in any data.\n</p>\n<p> 15.4 resell or otherwise supply our services to anyone else without our prior written consent.\n</p>\n<p> 15.5 open multiple free accounts.\n</p>\n<p> 15.6 make use of any additional services which are not meant to be available to you on the plan you have subscribed for (including without limitation additional storage or additional functionality) and for the avoidance of doubt, this includes where, for whatever reason, we may have provided you access to such services.\n</p>\n<p> 15.7 use our service: </p>\n<p> 15.7.1 to store, use, download, upload, share, access, transmit, or otherwise make available, data in violation of any law in any country (including to breach copyright or other intellectual property rights held by us or anyone else).\n</p>\n<p> 15.7.2 to send unwelcome communications of any kind (including but not limited to unlawful unsolicited commercial communications) to anyone (e.g.\nspam or chain letters).\n</p>\n<p> 15.7.3 to abuse, defame, threaten, stalk or harass anyone, or to harm

etc.).\n</p>\n<p> 15.7.8 to attempt to gain unauthorised access to any services other than those to which you have been given express permission to access.\nor </p>\n<p> 15.7.9 to impersonate anyone or to try to trick or defraud anyone for any reason (e.g.\nby claiming to be someone you are not).\n</p>\n<p> 16 If you register with us, you will need to use a password in conjunction with your specific account email address.\nYou need to make sure your password is secure, not used by you on other sites and confidential.\nMake sure you tell us straight away if you think or know someone else has used your password or there has been any other security breach.\nWe will hold you responsible for anything done using your account and password.\nMAKE YOUR PASSWORD A STRONG ONE AND KEEP IT SECURE.\nWe are not responsible if someone else gains access to your computer or other device and/or your Mega password and/or encryption keys for any files.\n</p> Intellectual Property Our IP <p> 17 You are not allowed to, and you can't let anyone else (including in particular any user within a business account of which you are administrator), use, copy, alter, distribute, display, licence,

using our services to infringe copyright.\nYou may not upload, download, store, share, access, display, stream, distribute, e-mail, link to, communicate, transmit, or otherwise make available any files, data, or content that infringes any copyright or other proprietary rights of any person or entity.\n</p>\n<p> 21 We will respond to notices of alleged copyright infringement that comply with

notice of alleged copyright infringement are on our contacts page.\n</p> Copyright Counter-Notices <p> 23 We process all takedown notices based on good faith acceptance of the representations from the party submitting the takedown notice.\nWe do not review the material before processing the takedown notice.\n</p>\n<p> 24 You may file a counter-notice if you believe that access to a file you have uploaded has been wrongly disabled because it was the subject of an incorrect takedown notice.\nYou should only do so if you are confident that no other party owns copyright in the material, or you have rights to store the material and, if you are sharing it, that you have the right to do so.\n</p>\n<p> 25 Please understand that: </p>\n<p> 25.1 when we receive your counter-notice, we pass it, including your address and other contact information, to the party who issued the original takedown notice.\nBy submitting your counter-notice you authorise us to do so.\n</p>\n<p> 25.2 filing a counter-notification may lead to legal proceedings between you and the complaining party.\n</p>\n<p> 25.3 there may be adverse legal consequences in New Zealand and/or your jurisdiction if you make a false or bad faith allegation by using this process.\n</p>\n<p> 25.4 if, when using this counter-notice process, you make a false or bad faith allegation or otherwise breach these terms or any of our

account.\n</p>\n<p> 29 If we do not receive any further communication from or on behalf of the person who originally submitted the takedown notice, or any communication we do receive does not in our sole opinion adequately justify the original takedown notice, we may, but shall not be obliged to, reinstate the material in approximately 10-14 days provided we have no reason to believe that the material infringes copyright.\n</p>\n<p> 30 Nothing in this counter-notice section prejudices our right to remove or disable access to any material at any time, for any reason or no reason.\n</p>

temporarily suspend your account, where a pattern of access to your account suggests to us that the account may have been compromised.\nYou will subsequently be required to provide such verification of your right to access your account, as we deem appropriate, before we will unsuspend your account.\n</p>\n<p> 35 We may also terminate, suspend or limit our services or any part of our services, for

notice to you.\nand </p>\n<p> 55.3 In the event that there is any dispute as to the amount of any payment due (for example in respect of the number of active users on your business account in any month) then our decision on such matter shall be final and binding, and in the absence of manifest error or other lawful error, you can't withhold payment or claim any set-off without getting our written agreement.\n</p>\n<p> 56 Where a business account recurring payment fails for any reason, after 7 days we may suspend the account and all users within that account until payment is made.\nIf no payment is made within a reasonable period of time, we will be entitled to terminate the business account and all users within that account, in which case all data and personal information associated with those users and the account will be subject to deletion in accordance with these terms.\n</p>\n<p> 57 Business accounts are subject to a fair use policy as follows: </p>\n<p> 57.1 Business accounts are only to be used for business purposes.\n</p>\n<p> 57.2 Business accounts are intended for multiple users and are not to be held or used by one person.\n</p>\n<p> 57.3 Each user must comply with these terms.\nAny breach of these terms by one user will be treated as a breach of these terms in respect of the whole account.\n</p>\n<p> 57.4 Mega will not be liable to any business account user should the actions of another user within the account, including the administrator of the business account, cause any loss or damage to another user within the business account (including by way of deletion, amendment, sharing or any other dealing with data or personal information).\nand </p>\n<p> 57.5 Each user\u2019s use of the business service must be fair, reasonable and not excessive, as reasonably determined by us by reference to average and/or estimated typical per business user usage of the business service.\nWe will consider usage to be excessive and unreasonable where it materially exceeds the average and/or estimated use patterns over any day, week or month (or other period of time as determined by us) (\u201c<b>excessive usage</b>\u201d).\nIf we identify excessive usage or consider that usage patterns on any business account indicate that any of the usage is not for business purposes we may suspend, and after 30 days\u2019 notice, terminate any or all of the users or the whole business account, in which case data and personal information associated with those users and the account will be subject to deletion in accordance with these terms.\nExamples of such unreasonable usage patterns also include: making non-business data publicly available, adding users who do not appear to Mega to be associated with the business, and uploading or sharing files from non-business related third party sites.\n</p> Refunds <p> 58 Unless otherwise provided by New Zealand law or by a particular service offer, all purchases are final and non-refundable.\nIf you believe that Mega has charged you in error, you must contact us within 90 days of such charge.\nNo refunds will be given for any charges more than 90 days old.\nWe reserve the right to issue refunds or credits at our sole discretion.\nIf we issue a refund or credit, we are under no obligation to issue the same or similar refund in the future.\nThis refund policy does not affect any statutory rights that may apply.\nIf you have made a payment by mistake and have not used the subscription plan services, you must contact support@mega.nz within 24 hours.\nThis will be acknowledged promptly and answered within 7 days.\n</p> Recurring Paid Subscriptions <p> 59 Recurring subscriptions will renew indefinitely, either monthly or annually, based upon your chosen subscription period, unless the subscription is cancelled prior to a renewal date.\nFor recurring subscriptions established via mobile apps using in-app-purchase platforms, you should refer to your app store account for details of the dates and terms of the subscription.\nAny other recurring subscription will renew on the same day of month as it was established, except in cases where the day is not available due to a short month, in which case the renewal date will be moved to the first day of the following month.\n</p> Cancellation of Recurring Paid Subscriptions <p> 60 Recurring subscriptions established through the mobile app using in-app-purchase platforms should be cancelled through the relevant app store account directly.\nAny other recurring subscription should be cancelled by navigating to https://mega.nz/account in your browser while you are logged into your account and selecting the option to cancel your subscription.\nAny payments processed after an effective subscription cancellation will be promptly refunded by us.\nIf you cancel a paid subscription, but you maintain your Mega account as a free account, access to your account may be restricted or blocked if the level of use is above the limits applying to free accounts at that time.\n</p> Information and Privacy <p> 61 We reserve the right to disclose data and other information as required by law or any competent authority.\nOur approach is referenced in our Privacy and Data Policy and Takedown Guidance Policy, both of which are subject to these terms.\n</p>\n<p> 62 You and anyone else you give access to are also bound by our Privacy and Data Policy, our Cookie Policy and Takedown Guidance Policy.\nBy accepting these terms, you also accept our Privacy and Data Policy, our Cookie Policy and Takedown Guidance Policy.\n</p> Notices <p> 63 You can contact us by sending an email to support@mega.nz.\nIf we need to contact you or provide you with notice we will email you at the email address you have recorded in your account details and such notices will be valid and deemed to be received by you whether or not you are using that address.\nWe may also send notices via any chat facility or internal messaging system we may provide.\n</p> Rights to Third Parties <p> 64 Mega Limited employees, officers, agents, related companies and affiliates together with authorised suppliers of services to and authorised resellers of, our services, are entitled to the benefit of all indemnities and other provisions of these terms which are for the benefit of Mega in these terms.\n</p> Entire Agreement <p> 65 These terms, our Privacy and Data Policy, our Cookie Policy and Takedown Guidance Policy, the terms of any plan you purchase and any other terms and policies expressly referenced in these terms, together constitute the entire agreement between us relating to your use of our services.\nFrom the date they come into force, in respect of any use of any of our services after that, they supersede and replace any prior agreement, arrangement or understanding between you and us regarding the use of our services.\nNo agreement, arrangement or understanding alleged to be made between us, or representation alleged to be made, by us or on our behalf, to you, if inconsistent with these terms, shall be valid unless agreed to in writing by an executive

processing of your personal information and the way in which we deal with other data that is not personal information.\n\u201c<b>Personal information</b>\u201d is the New Zealand term for \u201c<b>personal data</b>\u201d as defined in the European Union\u2019s General Data Protection Regulation EU2016/679 (\u201c<b>GDPR</b>\u201d).\nThe term \u201c<b>processing</b>\u201d is used as defined in the GDPR.\nIt includes collection, storage, and all of the ways we use, and allow you to use, personal information, when we provide our services.\nYou are the data controller under the GDPR of the personal information you provide to us as part of your Account Data (see below).\nMega Limited (New Zealand company number 4136598) (\u201c<b>MEGA</b>\u201d, \u201c<b>we</b>\u201d, \u201c<b>us</b>\u201d or \u201c<b>our</b>\u201d) of Level 21, Huawei Centre, 120 Albert Street, Auckland, New Zealand is the data controller under the GDPR of all other personal information.\n</p>\n<p> 2 <b>Important:</b> We store all data on servers in New Zealand, Canada and/or Europe.\nIf you access your data or give someone else access to your data using our services and you or they are not in New Zealand, Canada or Europe, you or they may be accessing that data from a country that does not give adequate protection to personal information when compared to that to that given under the New Zealand Privacy Act 2020, the Canadian Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act 2000 or the GDPR.\nUnder our Terms of Service (\u201c<b>Terms</b>\u201d) you authorise us to grant this access.\n</p>\n<p> 3 This Policy is divided into five sections to make it easier for you to see which provisions apply to different types of data.\nWords and phrases which are defined in our Terms have the same meanings when they are used in this Policy.\n</p>\n<p> 4 The sections of this Policy are: </p>\n<p> 4.1 This Introduction section.\n</p>\n<p> 4.2 The \u201c<b>Your Files</b>\u201d section.\nThis covers the actual encrypted files that you upload, access and share using our services.\n</p>\n<p> 4.3 The \u201c<b>Your Chats</b>\u201d section.\nThis covers the encrypted text, voice and video chats you engage in using our services.\n</p>\n<p> 4.4 The \u201c<b>Account Data</b>\u201d section.\nThis covers the metadata that is collected and generated by our systems when you use our services, and the information that you provide to us when you register and communicate with us.\n</p>\n<p> 4.5 The \u201c<b>Usage Data</b>\u201d section.\nThis covers the data that is collected and generated when you use our services.\n</p>\n<p> 4.6 The \u201c<b>General</b>\u201d section, which applies to all our services and all types of data.\n</p>\n<p> 5 The GDPR provides rights to European users, but, as a leading privacy company, we make the GDPR protections and rights available to all our users globally in respect of their personal data (or \u201c<b>personal information</b>\u201d as we refer to it in New Zealand), wherever you may live.\n</p> Your Files <p> 6 This is the section of this Policy that covers the actual encrypted files that you upload, access and share using our services (\u201c<b>Your Files</b>\u201d).\nThe following specific terms apply: </p>\n<p> 6.1 When you upload a file, it is already encrypted at your device, so we do not know whether it is personal to you or someone else, relates to a business or some other organisation, or what it contains.\nWe also generate and store encrypted previews of images, videos and certain other types of file.\nWe gather a small amount of metadata about the type of file, but that does not disclose the content or information that the file contains.\nIn relation to metadata, see the section of this Policy specifically covering Account Data.\n</p>\n<p> 6.2 All Your Files remain encrypted at all times while they are on our system.\nThey are never received, stored or otherwise dealt with by us in unencrypted form because any decryption takes place only on your device or that of another user to whom you have provided the file/folder links and keys that are created when you give them access.\nYour Files are therefore not personal data under the GDPR (or \u201c<b>personal information</b>\u201d as we refer to it under the New Zealand Privacy Act 2020) since they are never held by MEGA in a form that is information about an identified or identifiable natural person.\n</p>\n<p> 6.3 We collect Your Files because that is necessary for us to provide our end-to-end encrypted cloud storage and collaboration services that you contract for when you agree to our Terms.\n</p>\n<p> 6.4 Although Your Files are not personal information within our system because you have encrypted them, you should know that we store Your Files and make them available from servers that are owned and controlled by us, in secure facilities in Europe or in countries (such as Canada or New Zealand) that the European Commission has determined to have an adequate level of protection under Article 45 of the GDPR and which have comparable protections to those given by the New Zealand Privacy Act 2020, depending where you are based.\nNone of Your Files are stored in, or made available from, the United States of America.\n</p>\n<p> 6.5 We keep Your Files while you are subscribed to our services but subject to our suspension and termination rights set out in our Terms.\nYou must maintain copies of Your Files.\nWe do not make any guarantees that there will be no loss of data or the services will be bug free.\nYou should download Your Files prior to termination of services including where the administrator of a business account, within which you have used the services, terminates that business account (see clause 13 below).\n<b>If you forget your password you will lose access to all Your Files unless you have exported a Recovery Key.</b>\n</p>\n<p> 6.6 When you delete one of Your Files it will be made inaccessible, marked for deletion and removed when the next appropriate file purging process is run, subject to any retention specifically allowed under this Policy or our Terms.\nAfter account termination, all Your Files will be marked for deletion and removed when the next appropriate file purging process is run, subject to any retention specifically allowed under this Policy or our Terms.\n</p>\n<p> 6.7 The deletion process specified in clause 6.6 will not apply to a deduplicated file that is associated with another user (see our Terms).\n</p>\n<p> 6.8 We may, but shall not be obliged to, keep Your Files after your account has been suspended or terminated.\nIn particular, we may, but shall not be obliged to, keep Your Files where we consider it necessary for evidential purposes relating to a breach of our Cookie Policy, Terms or with respect to current or anticipated action by any competent enforcement authority or other third party.\nWith respect to release of Your Files to competent enforcement authorities and third parties, see our Takedown Guidance Policy.\n</p>\n<p> 6.9 See also the General section of this Policy which applies to all types of data, including Your Files.\n</p> Your Chats <p>7 This is the section of this Policy that covers the content of your text, voice and video chats (\u201c<b>Your Chats</b>\u201d).\nThe following specific terms apply: </p>\n<p> 7.1 For private chats, only the people using the accounts that you\u2019re engaging with in the chat can read, see or hear the chat content posted while they were a member of that chat group.\nPublic chats can be read by anyone who has the link to that chat.\nEvery text message you send is stored as an encrypted binary large object (\u201c<b>blob</b>\u201d).\nThe times and participants of your successful and unsuccessful chats are stored in unencrypted form.\nThe content of voice and video chats is not retained.\nIf you have enabled rich URL previews, a plain text preview is generated in our system but is stored separately.\nWhen you review the text or voice chat history and contents, or reinitiate that chat with the same participant(s), the blobs are decrypted in your browser or mobile app.\n</p>\n<p> 7.2 All Your Chats remain encrypted at all times while they are on our system.\nThey are never stored or otherwise dealt with by us in unencrypted form because encryption and any decryption of the blob takes place only on your device.\nYour Chats are therefore not personal data under the GDPR (or \u201c<b>personal information</b>\u201d as we refer to it under the New Zealand Privacy Act 2020) since they are never held by MEGA in a form that is information about an identified or identifiable natural person.\n</p>\n<p> 7.3 We retain and store Your Chats because that is necessary for us to provide our end-to-end encrypted chat service that you contract for when you agree to our Terms.\n</p>\n<p> 7.4 Although Your Chats are not personal information within our system because you have encrypted them, you should know that we store Your Chats and make them available in encrypted form from servers that are owned and controlled by us, in secure facilities in Europe or in countries (such as Canada or New Zealand) that the European Commission has determined to have an adequate level of protection under Article 45 of the GDPR or which have comparable protections to those given by the New Zealand Privacy Act 2020, depending where you are based.\nNone of Your Chats are stored in, or made available from, the United States of America.\n</p>\n<p> 7.5 We keep Your Chats while you are subscribed to our services but subject to our suspension and termination rights set out in our Terms.\nWe do not make any guarantees that there will be no loss of data or the services will be bug free.\n</p>\n<p> 7.6 Chats may be deleted by the moderator of the chat, which may be you or another Mega user (depending on who has initiated the chat and been granted moderator rights).\nWhen the moderator deletes the chat history it will be removed from his or her chat and will no longer be accessible to any participant in that chat.\n</p>\n<p> 7.7 See also the General section of this Policy which applies to all types of data, including Your Chats.\n</p> Account Data <p> 8 This is the section of this Policy that covers account information you give us, and metadata and records of financial transactions that we generate in relation to Your Files, Your Chats and your account.\nThe following specific terms apply: </p>\n<p> 8.1 When you sign up for particular services you will need to give us the details required in our registration form and will need to keep that information up to date, including any payment account details (e.g.\nonline payment provider account information) </p>\n<p> 8.2 You do not need to give us any information other than an email address to use a free MEGA account, but the volume of Your Files that you can store and some other functionality is limited with such accounts.\nWhere you wish to access greater storage and other functionality under a paid plan, you will need to give us (including our related or affiliated entities, payment processors and resellers) the information (such as tax identification and payment information) that is required under the particular plan and our Terms in relation to those services.\nFor paid plans MEGA and its related or affiliated entities, payment processors and resellers that you use to make payments, retain account and payment information including a record of all transactions on your account.\n</p>\n<p> 8.3 When you use our services, our systems retain the following metadata in unencrypted form: </p>\n<p> 8.3.1 Browser type and operating system of the devices from which you have logged in to MEGA.\n</p>\n<p> 8.3.2 IP address and port information for logins, API usage, file uploads, folder creations and link exports.\n</p>\n<p> 8.3.3 The country that we expect you are accessing our services from (inferred by matching your IP address to a public IP address database).\n</p>\n<p> 8.3.4 File sizes, versioning order, timestamps and parent-child file relationships.\n</p>\n<p> 8.3.5 Deletion timestamps.\n</p>\n<p> 8.3.6 The email address of anyone you have specifically made a contact using Mega's systems.\nNote that Your Files and folders can be shared privately by invitation to specified email addresses or shared more generally by creating a file or folder link and decryption key.\n</p>\n<p> 8.3.7 Contact email addresses of chat participants, chat commencement time and chat duration, and moderation activity.\n</p>\n<p> 8.3.8 Takedowns and account suspensions.\n</p>\n<p> 8.3.9 Our communications with you.\nand </p>\n<p> 8.3.10 Your personal account settings, including any avatar picture.\n</p>\n<p> 8.4 From time to time we may need to communicate with each other directly.\nWe will use Mega\u2019s chat facility, internal messaging system or the email address you have included in the settings information in your account.\nAny communication to you will be deemed to be received by you in accordance with the electronic communication provisions of the New Zealand Contract and Commercial Law Act 2017, no matter whether you are actively monitoring the account or its email address or not.\nYou can communicate with us using the appropriate address on our contacts page and your email will be deemed to be received by us in accordance with the electronic communication provisions of the New Zealand Contract and Commercial Law Act 2017.\nExamples of direct communications include copyright or other enforcement emails, notifications under our Takedown Guidance Policy, system update information, data breach notifications, notification of major changes to our Terms, our Cookie Policy or this Policy and billing information.\n</p>\n<p> 8.5 Access to your account is by way of nominated email address and password.\nIt is your responsibility to keep these safe and secure as Mega stores the email address but does not store the password.\n<b>If you forget your password you will lose access to all your data unless you have exported a Recovery Key.</b>\n</p>\n<p> 8.6 We will collect, store, use and otherwise process Account Data so that we can provide the services you have contracted to obtain from us under our Terms.\nWe also have a legitimate interest in processing Account Data so that we can maintain and improve our systems and services and communicate with you as referenced in this Policy.\n</p>\n<p> 8.7 We retain Account Data as long as your account is active.\nAfter account suspension or termination, including where the administrator of a business account, within which you have used the services, terminates that business account (see clause 13 below), we may, but shall not be obliged to, retain all Account Data if enforcement action is likely or commenced under our Terms, our Cookie Policy, or Takedown Guidance Policy or for 12 months, whichever is longer, or in the case of records of financial transactions relating to your account for such period of time as we are legally required to retain such information.\nUsers sometimes request that an account be re-activated so we keep Account Data for 12 months for that purpose.\nWhere there is no enforcement action likely or commenced and the 12 month period has expired, or after such longer period as is applicable in the case of records of financial transactions relating to your account that we are legally required to retain, Account Data that identifies you will be anonymised, but where you are a contact of, have had a folder shared with you by, or have chatted with, another MEGA user, those details will continue to be retained to allow services to continue for those other users.\nSee also the General section of this Policy with regard to retention.\n</p>\n<p> 8.8 You can download your Account Data at https://mega.nz/fm/account/history while you are logged into your account.\nThis will provide your Account Data but not Your Files.\nYou can request correction of Account Data if it is considered incorrect, in accordance with the New Zealand Privacy Act 2020 and the GDPR.\nAny requests for access to, or correction of, Account Data that is not available to you when you are logged into your account, or if you cannot log in to your account, should be made to privacy@mega.nz specifying the information in question.\nThe information will be provided promptly, and at least within one month, without charge unless the request is manifestly unfounded or excessive.\nCorrections will be promptly considered and actioned if appropriate.\n</p>\n<p> 8.9 If MEGA has disclosed the Account Data to any third party (such as a compliance authority), it will inform them of any correction where possible and will also inform the individuals about the third parties to whom the data has been disclosed where lawful and appropriate.\n</p>\n<p> 8.10 See also the General section of this Policy which applies to all types of data, including Account Data.\n</p> Usage Data <p> 9 This is the section of this Policy that covers your activity using our services (\u201c<b>Usage Data</b>\u201d).\nOur Cookie Policy provides more specific information on certain types of Usage Data and your rights to control when it is collected and what it is used for.\nSubject at all times to the rights you have pursuant to our Cookie Policy the following specific terms apply: </p>\n<p> 9.1 We may: </p>\n<p> 9.1.1 collect Usage Date to assist in the operation and improvement of our services.\n</p>\n<p> 9.1.2 join Usage Data with other users' data and give it to advertisers in a way which doesn't personally identify any particular user.\n</p>\n<p> 9.1.3 analyse and use Usage Data for marketing or statistical purposes as well as to improve the way we do business with our users.\nand </p>\n<p> 9.1.4 serve advertisements or use third-party advertising companies to serve advertisements on our services and on third party sites, as well as to assist us in analysing our marketing and other business efforts.\n</p>\n<p> 9.2 We collect and keep Usage Data with your consent to provide services and support related to our services, for market and product research and to be able to give users promotional material and special offers on our services.\n</p>\n<p> 9.3 See also the General section of this Policy which applies to all types of data, including Usage Data.\n</p> General <p> 10 This is the section of this Policy that covers all types of data.\n</p> Basis of processing and dealing with data <p> 11 As noted above, we process your personal information because we have contracted with you to do so under our Terms, this Policy, our Cookie Policy and our Takedown Guidance Policy.\nWe cannot provide our services without that data.\nOther data that is not personal information is also dealt with by us in accordance with our Terms, this Policy, our Cookie Policy and our Takedown Guidance Policy.\n</p> Giving access to other users <p> 12 You must ensure that anyone to whom you give access to any of Your Files, Your Chats or your Account Data complies with our Terms, our Cookie Policy, our Takedown Guidance Policy and this Policy.\nYou are responsible for their compliance.\nThis applies particularly where you are the administrator of a business account.\n</p>\n<p> 13 For business accounts, the administrator of that account can see and deal with the files and data associated with all users within that account (including any data and any personal information).\nIn addition: </p>\n<p> 13.1 if the business account is suspended or terminated, the action will affect the data and personal information of every user within that account.\n</p>\n<p> 13.2 the administrator of the business account will be able to see and deal with, change or delete the files and data associated with every user within that account (including any of Your Data, Your Chats, Account Data and any of your personal information).\nand </p>\n<p> 13.3 the administrator of the business account will be able to terminate any user\u2019s account within the business account, restrict or disable usage of the account, change any user\u2019s password and otherwise deny access to the account and you will then lose access to all Your Data, Your Chats, Account Data and all personal information associated with your usage of the business account.\n</p> Your own security practices are critical <p> 14 We strongly urge you to use best practices for ensuring the safety of your systems and devices (e.g.\nvia strong unique passwords, security upgrades, firewall protection, anti-virus software, securing devices).\nMEGA will never send an email asking for your password, so do not be fooled by any such email since it will not be from us.\nWe cannot guarantee the security of computers or devices nor of transmission from and to your device over the Internet and thus cannot guarantee there will be no unauthorised access.\nAlso, if you lose or otherwise allow access to your password or encryption keys, you will lose the security of all your data.\nIf you forget your password you will lose access to all your data unless you have exported a Recovery Key.\nUsing the same password for MEGA as you have used at other sites can lead to others accessing and taking control of your MEGA account if one of those other sites is breached or hacked.\n</p> Disclosure for civil or criminal enforcement <p> 15 If we think it is necessary or we are obliged by law in any jurisdiction, then we are entitled to give Your Files, Your Chats, any Account Data and any Usage Data to competent authorities, even if those items are encrypted.\nWe reserve the right to assist any law enforcement agency with investigations, including disclosure of information to them or their agents.\nWe also reserve the right to comply with any legal processes, including but not limited to data breach notification processes, subpoenas, search warrants and court orders initiated by enforcement authorities or other third parties.\nWe may disclose Your Files, Your Chats, any Account Data and any Usage Data to enforce or apply our Terms, our Cookie Policy, our Takedown Guidance Policy and this Policy or any other agreement we have with you, or to protect the rights, property, or safety of us or our other users, third parties or the operation of our services.\nFor more detail on disclosure to competent enforcement authorities and other third parties, see our Takedown Guidance Policy.\n</p> Mega Limited and its related or affiliated entities, payment processors and resellers <p> 16 You have a contract with Mega Limited (New Zealand company number 4136598) but our services (including payment and personal information processing) may be provided by Mega Limited's related or affiliated entities, payment processors and resellers, in other jurisdictions, subject to applicable laws.\nYou authorise Mega Limited and each of those related or affiliated entities to collect, store, share and otherwise process Your Files, Your Chats, any Account Data and any Usage Data among themselves, as necessary to provide the services, subject to applicable laws.\nAll such entities are located in Europe or in countries (such as Canada or New Zealand) that the European Commission has determined to have an adequate level of protection under Article 45 of the GDPR or which have comparable protections to those given under the New Zealand Privacy Act 2020.\nYou authorise Mega Limited and each of those related or affiliated entities, payment processors and resellers to collect, store, share and otherwise process among themselves such Account Data as is necessary to provide payment processing, subject to applicable laws.\n</p> No commercial sale of data <p> 17 We will never sell Your Files, Your Chats, any Account Data or any Usage Data.\nWe will not disclose or otherwise provide Your Files, Your Chats, any Account Data or any Usage Data to a third party, or make any other use of Your Files, Your Chats, any Account Data or any Usage Data, for any purpose which is not specifically allowed under this Policy, our Cookie Policy, our Terms or our Takedown Guidance Policy or is not incidental to the normal use of our services.\n</p> Mega\u2019s data security <p> 18 Data security is very important to Mega, whether that is your personal information or any other data.\nThat is why we publish our client-side browser and mobile app software, provide a bug bounty to encourage reporting on any issues, and why we have provided information in this Policy on collection and storage of all data whether or not it is personal information.\nFor more information on our security practices, see our security.\n</p> Communications <p> 19 We may send invoices, security or service updates and various other notices by email to the email address listed in your account or using any of our chat or messaging systems.\nThey will be deemed to be received in accordance with our Terms.\n</p>\n<p> 20 If appropriate, some of those notices will contain unsubscribe information so you can opt out of further receipt.\nWe will abide by any email unsubscription request (other than those we need to send for invoicing, security or service updates and other service provider purposes).\n</p>\n<p> 21 In some cases a person may receive an email from us asking the person to confirm their new Mega account email address, but in fact they haven't tried to open an account - someone else has started the process and used their email address either maliciously or by mistake.\nIn these cases, Mega has an ephemeral/incomplete account that might be used to upload files.\nOn request, and after proving ownership of the email address, we will arrange for the account to be deleted.\n</p> Law <p> 22 Subject to the rights that those in the European Union have under the GDPR, this Policy and its interpretation and operation are governed solely by New Zealand law.\nSubject to the rights that those in the European Union have under the GDPR, you, MEGA and all users, submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the New

"name": "Cookie Policy", "url": "https://mega.nz/cookie", "xpath": "/html/body/div[6]/div[2]/div[4]/div", "text": " Our Cookie Policy <p> In this Cookie Policy and on our Cookie Settings page we collectively refer to browser cookies and all similar types of technologies (such as local storage, web beacons and device identifiers, which we talk more about below) as \u2018Cookies\u2019.\n</p>\n<p> In this Cookie Policy you can find out about the types of Cookies we use when you access our services and also what is done with the information collected from you via those Cookies.\nWe also explain how you can opt out of our use of Cookies where it is possible to do so.\n</p> Technologies We Use Browser Cookies <p> Browser cookies are small amounts of data that a website places on your computer or mobile device.\nThese browser cookies can be used to store information about the actions you take on the websites you visit, like the pages you\u2019ve looked at and any preferences such as the language or screen layout that you\u2019ve selected.\n</p>\n<p> Browser cookies and all the similar types of technologies we talk about further below, can identify your device, but they can\u2019t identify you personally.\n</p>\n<p> Any browser cookies that we set when you visit our website or use our apps are called \u2018first party cookies\u2019 as we control them.\nHowever, when we use a browser cookie created by someone else (such as an advertising associate), it is referred to as a \u2018third party cookie\u2019 as we don\u2019t control the data that is collected by that third party cookie.\n</p>\n<p> You can find out about the specific third party cookies we use by heading to the Third Party Cookies page in our Cookie Settings.\n</p>\n<p> On the Third Party Cookies page you can also find links to the privacy policy of each third party cookie that we use.\nThese specific third party privacy policies (and not this Cookie Policy or our Privacy and Data Policy) will govern how any information collected by those third party cookies is used.\n</p> Local Storage <p> Local storage works in a similar way to browser cookies.\nLocal storage consists of a small amount of data that is stored on your computer or mobile device.\nLocal storage has some technical advantages over browser cookies in terms of the amount of data it can store, how long it can exist for and the more efficient way it transmits information.\nLocal storage is also used in the same way as browser cookies for remembering things such as any preferences like the language or screen layout that you\u2019ve selected.\n</p> Web Beacons <p> A web beacon is a tiny transparent image file placed on a webpage that can be used, often in conjunction with browser cookies, to track your visits to, and interaction with, the webpage.\nWeb beacons can also be used to track your journey across a website or a series of websites.\n</p>\n<p> When you open a page with a web beacon the small file is downloaded after sending a message to a remote computer across the internet where the original image is stored.\nThis message will include information such as your IP address and the time the web beacon was triggered.\nWeb beacons can be used to identify the elements of a webpage that you might have interacted with including specific adverts.\n</p>\n<p> Web beacons can also operate through a Beacon API to send tracking events such as page views directly to API servers.\n</p> Tracking URLs <p> These are specially formatted URLs that let us know when they have been clicked.\nThey help us track things like when a particular link in an email is clicked on or which option on a webpage is chosen more often.\n</p> Device Identifiers <p> When you access our services our system will generate a device ID (that doesn\u2019t include the serial number, brand or model of your device) and assign this to our record of your device.\n</p>\n<p> We regard the use of device identifiers as being essential to offering you our services and therefore (as allowed by law) the use of device identifiers on our services cannot be turned off.\n</p> Cookie Categories <p> Based on the functionality they provide, we classify all the \u2018Cookies\u2019 we use (including browser cookies, local storage, web beacons, tracking URLs and device identifiers) into the following categories: </p>\n<ul>\n<li>Essential</li>\n<li>Preference</li>\n<li>Performance and Analytics</li>\n<li>Advertising</li>\n</ul>\n<p> In our Cookie Settings you are able to select (with the exception of Essential Cookies as explained below) the categories of Cookies we can use whenever you access our services.\n</p> Essential Cookies <p> These are essential for providing you with important functionality and secure access to our services.\nWithout them, we couldn\u2019t offer you the services we do.\nFor this reason, they do not require consent.\nWe use Essential Cookies to: </p>\n<ul>\n<li> assist in securely connecting you to our services.\n</li>\n<li> ensure our technical infrastructure is operating efficiently in order to deliver our services to you in an optimal way.\n</li>\n<li> identify if you have previously requested the \u2018remember me\u2019 option so as to be automatically logged in when you return to use our services.\n</li>\n<li> determine if you have logged in and then keep you logged in for either the duration of your current session or for future visits as well if you have previously requested the \u2018remember me\u2019 option when logging in.\n</li>\n<li> identify and take action against malicious threats to our system.\n</li>\n<li> observe activity on our services and detect any actions which are against our Terms of Service or that may negatively impact on the quality of use of our services for other users.\nand </li>\n<li> assist you to make purchases from us.\n</li>\n</ul> Preference Cookies <p> These Cookies allow us to remember certain display and formatting settings you have chosen.\nNot accepting these Cookies will mean we won\u2019t be able to remember some things for you such as your preferred screen layout.\nWe use Preference Cookies to: </p>\n<ul>\n<li> remember the preferences you select for how various screens in our system should display (such as your Folder view in Cloud Drive) so that they can be displayed in the same way the next time you visit them.\nand </li>\n<li> remember the language you have chosen that you wish to use our services in.\n</li>\n</ul> Performance and Analytics Cookies <p> These Cookies help us to understand how you use our services and provide us data that we can utilise to make improvements.\nNot accepting these Cookies will mean we will have less data available to help make improvements.\nWe use Performance and Analytics Cookies to: </p>\n<ul>\n<li> identify the parts of our services that you use more than others and how well different parts of our services function.\n</li>\n<li> observe the devices and settings you use when you access our services to help us to determine what improvements would be beneficial for us to make to our services.\nand </li>\n<li> monitor any changes we make to our services to see if they improve your user experience.\n</li>\n</ul> Advertising Cookies <p> These Cookies are used by us and our approved advertising partners to customise adverts which are shown by us on our services and by third parties on our services and on other websites and services.\nNot accepting these Cookies means you may be shown advertisements that are less relevant.\nWe and our approved advertising partners use Advertising Cookies to: </p>\n<ul>\n<li> monitor how often you are displayed certain adverts.\n</li>\n<li> customise the adverts you see based on such things as your location and your actions on our services and the actions you have taken on other websites and services you have previously visited.\nand </li>\n<li> tell us when you click on a particular advert and then to track the following actions you take in response to that advert.\n</li>\n</ul> Managing Cookies <p> When you first access our services, you will be shown a brief message explaining what we use Cookies for.\nYou can either accept the use of all Cookies on our services, or if you do not wish to accept the use of some Cookies, you can go to our Cookie Settings to specify your preferences.\nThese preferences will be saved so that the next time you access our services you do not have to make your choices again.\nYou can also adjust the preferences you have selected at any time by accessing the Cookie Settings page again from the link in the footer of our website or from the Settings page in our mobile apps.\n</p>\n<p> Please note that if you choose to disable some or all Cookies in your browser, it will limit the functionality that different websites and services (including ours) can make available to you.\n</p> Related Terms <p> This Cookie Policy, our Terms of Service, our Privacy and Data Policy, and Takedown Guidance Policy, the terms of any plan you purchase and any other terms and policies expressly referenced in those documents, together constitute the entire agreement between us relating to your use of our services.\nWhere there is any inconsistency between those documents, to the greatest extent at law, the Terms of Service prevail.\nAll defined terms in our Terms of Service shall have the same meaning in this Cookie Policy.\nTo the greatest extent permitted at law all limitations and exclusions of liability set out in our Terms of Service apply equally to this Cookie Policy.\n</p>\n<p>Last updated 18 December 2020, effective 18 January 2021.</p> ", "created_at":
